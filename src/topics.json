Unlike existing campaign finance law, which regulates speech that either expressly advocates a candidate’s election or defeat or that mentions a candidate in relatively close temporal proximity to an election, the vague and overly broad new definition of PASO communications applies year-round and threatens to consume any legislative advocacy that dares mention an elected official. The penalties imposed by H.R. 1 for engaging in PASO communications are severe – a group that spends more than an aggregate of $10,000 on such communications over a two-year election cycle must, among other things, file reports publicly disclosing all of its donors who have given it more than $10,000 during the election cycle.

That bill, which the House of Representatives has already passed, would codify the Dynamex ABC test and apply it nationwide. California’s lawsuit and the PRO Act make clearwhat organized labor and its political allies want, even if it means undermining businesses that offer greater economic opportunity, not to mention a safe ride home.",

Because of the pervasiveness of the omicron variant, increased immunity and higher vaccination in the U.S., the pre-departure testing requirement can be eliminated for fully vaccinated individuals without increasing the spread of COVID-19. Removing the pre-departure testing requirement will incentivize vaccination, increase demand for international travel to and from the U.S., and better align passenger aviation entry requirements with those at U.S. land border points of entry and other major travel-trade partners abroad (e.g., the United Kingdom and European Union).",

Researchers at University of Pennsylvania, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, spent over a decade conducting research on synthetic mRNA and published the findings in 2005. This foundational research inspired founders of Moderna to use mRNA for medicines and raised $2 billion on the concept before going public in 2018. Soon after the world became aware of the COVID-19 virus, Moderna researchers used the mRNA technique to create a vaccine and was one of the first drugmakers to develop a vaccine suitable for clinical trials. Operation Warp Speed, through funding appropriated by the CARES Act, provided Moderna with $2.58 billion in two grants to facilitate development of their vaccine.Likewise, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also utilized mRNA to develop a COVID19 vaccine. BioNTech similarly licensed the novel technology developed at the University of Pennsylvania to try to harness the medical potential of mRNA. At the onset of the pandemic, BioNTech partnered with Pfizer, an 171 year old biopharmaceutical company, to develop and test their mRNA vaccine candidate. While Pfizer did not receive R&D funding through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government agreed to pay $1.95 billion to purchase 100 million doses of the vaccine.Federal support for basic research is not the only public policy whose benefits are highlighted by the new vaccines. Immigrant innovators were often the tip of the spear, and the ability of firms to draw on global production networks sourcing inputs from around the globe has proven essential to the development and deployment—with unprecedented speed—of these novel and impressive vaccines. There are important lessons here for elected officials considering the direction of U.S. immigration, trade, and supply chain policies.Last December, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorizations for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines. The story of both vaccines illustrates how basic federal funding – for either R&D or the medicines themselves – paired with private sector expertise can lead to game-changing medical innovations in record time.",

In addition to this issue, this testimony examines industry’s overall role in facilitating R&D, key challenges and opportunities, reasons to prioritize investments in R&D, importance of tax policy and intellectual property protections, and policy recommendations for Congress to bolster our national research enterprise, and sustain America’s leadership in R&D. Congressional leadership in this area that has been most effective and stood the test of time, such as the Bayh-Dole Act and the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, have been bipartisan efforts and we hope this Congress continues that tradition.",

Semiconductors are essential to nearly every sector of the economy, including aerospace, automobiles, communications, clean energy, information technology, and medical devices. Unfortunately, demand for semiconductors has outstripped supply, partly due to shifts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created a global chip shortage and resulted in lost growth and jobs, in turn underscoring the need for increased domestic manufacturing capacity. Approval of these provisions will help meet this long-term challenge by incentivizing semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing in the United States. This will in turn strengthen the U.S. economy, national security, and supply chain resilience and increase the supply of chips so important to our entire economy.",

USCIS should update the M-274 Handbook for Employers to clarify that employers may accept electronic USCIS approval notices for Form I-9 purposes.

That's because strong IP systems enable allocation of resources, forming partnerships, and transferring technology on commercial terms. For example, robust IP systems facilitated hundreds of voluntary licensing agreements that powered the rapid scale-up of global manufacturing, especially in the life sciences industry. As of January 2022, there were nearly 330 voluntary partnerships and collaborations among manufacturers facilitating the production of billions of doses of vaccines and over 110 voluntary partnerships enabling the production of therapeutics, all supported by the contractual licensing of IP rights.

The Department decided that doing so would minimize volatility in unit costs.

However, the Department provided no explanation in its NPRM as to how these proclamations factored into its formulation for its cost estimates. Presumably, these proclamations will not exist in perpetuity, and employers hope that the State Department made reasonable assumptions as to how such proclamations would impact its cost modeling. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the NPRM to show employers how these presidential proclamations, particularly the increased resources needed to comply with them, influenced how the new CoSM used by the Department helped them arrive at their proposed fee increases.

Broadband access is also important for the use of online productivity tools, and of course, to businesses whose business model relies on consumer access to broadband. Moreover, the economic implications are substantial; IoT is expected to provide a total economic impact of $14.4 trillion by 2025. The digital economy already provides $2 trillion in annual value to the U.S. economy.

The annual report reviews the global state of intellectual property (IP) rights protection and enforcement.“Innovations enabled by IP are delivering us from the current pandemic, and can defend us against the next one – if predictable, reliable, and enforceable intellectual property rights remain available world-wide to secure the underlying investments. USTR’s work to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the global IP infrastructure is critical to a healthy innovation ecosystem. With the Special 301 Report as a blueprint, we can enhance the legal and economic environment to support the vaccine researchers, movie and music producers, scientific journal publishers, software and telecommunications engineers, and countless others whose cutting-edge products have supported us throughout this crisis.“This year, in its filing, the U.S. Chamber identified systemic and market-specific IP issues in global markets like: Brazil, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Vietnam, Turkey, Korea, China, and Mexico (among others). We focused on harmful policy realities like: insufficient patent protection; compulsory licensing; inadequate responses to counterfeiting and piracy; forced screen and broadcast quotas; localization requirements; regulatory approval delays; unfair competition law proceedings and extraterritorial remedies; data transfer restrictions; and general market access barriers.“Today, we reiterate our concern that the mistaken belief that IP rights can be a barrier to access for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has induced some countries, U.N agencies and special interest groups to seek to undermine those rights. Let me be clear: IP rights help – they don’t hinder – access to innovation by enabling long-term investments in technology in the first instance, and by supporting a wide range of public and private partnerships to appropriately share know-how and capabilities through IP licensing.  The U.S. Chamber International IP Index shows that countries with strong IP systems have significantly higher innovation production, invention rates, and knowledge output – as well as greater access to innovation.“We thank USTR and the U.S. government as a whole for their consideration of our filing and, more importantly, we commend them for their efforts to promote and protect American intellectual property at home and around the world.”",

States and employers continue to struggle with labor shortages, increasing the difficulty of generating UI tax revenues. To counter this obstacle, the Chamber calls on Congress to support the reinstatement of the interest waiver which will allow states to address outstanding loans and interest payments without incurring more debt. Second, Congress appropriated $350 billion in State & Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) as part of ARPA for states to respond to the public health emergency. The Chamber urges states to use the SLFRF funds towards outstanding loans or accrued interest, or to replenish the state’s UI trust fund to pre-pandemic levels. States must be aware that per Treasury’s final rule, changes to a state’s maximum benefit entitlement are prohibited if SLFRF funds are used towards outstanding loans or interest payments.",

Despite preparations, most states’ trust funds were unable to support the extraordinary number of UI claimants ushered in by the Pandemic. At the height of the Pandemic, 23 states borrowed money from the federal government to pay regular UI benefits. Most of these states were able to repay their loans and replenish their trust funds. Nine states, however, still collectively owe more than $40 billion today. Additionally, interest payments on the loans are due September 30 of this year.

Under the AI, all of these factors were to be considered together, with no specific factor or factors being considered more important than the others. Because of this, an employer would never be able to tell whether they had properly classified a worker as an employee or an independent contractor until the WHD made the determination. The AI was rescinded by the Trump DOL and replaced with a balanced regulation that ordered the various factors so that employers would be able to properly classify a worker as an employee or independent contractor.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars a year in illicit profit. All victims of trafficking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.Industry has an important role to play. Businesses cannot do this work alone. The business community needs to partner with governments and non-governmental organizations to address the scope of this problemBusinesses face an economic, legal, and reputational risk if they engage in human trafficking. The task force develops toolkits, hosts forums, and engages in advocacy work to shine a spotlight on this problem.According to the International Labor Organization, whereas 19% of victims are trafficked for commercial sex and make up a vast majority of illicit profits, incidences of forced labor are prevalent and widespread globally. To eradicate human trafficking, the task force addresses forced labor in supply chains and commercial sex trafficking.To conduct sex trafficking, traffickers rely on the transportation and hospitality sectors for moving and controlling victims, giving these sectors a critical role as the first line of defense.Regarding forced labor, repeal of the consumptive demand clause in 2016 heightened the need for businesses to be cognizant of labor risks.The financial sector also plays a role in eliminating forced labor. Since 2018, financial institutions such as banks have been required by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to identify and report suspicious activity related to human trafficking.Employers, in conjunction with social service providers, counseling firms, housing agencies, and skills-based training organizations, provide resources for human trafficking victims to heal. This work is done in conjunction with comprehensive social service providers and researchers.As the leading voice of business, the U.S. Chamber plays a critical role in addressing human trafficking. This report outlines activities that the task force has undertaken. These resources include a description of toolkits developed with partners; event summaries; and an overview of the U.S. Chamber’s lobbying and advocacy efforts.We hope that you will join us as we continue to grow this initiative.",

Further, while the Chamber strongly supports USTR’s existing mission to develop and coordinate international trade policy and negotiations with other countries, it lacks the resources and experience to scrutinize U.S. investments abroad for potential national security risks as this measure proposes.

The financial pressure would be particularly acute for mid-size and small businesses, including those in the hospitality and retail industries, and ultimately, many companies may be forced to forego providing coverage altogether for employees. The net impact would be 300,000 Americans facing a reduction or total loss of employer-sponsored insurance and a steep increase in federal deficits by $10.8 billion to cover the cost of enrollees transitioning to public programs.",

Demand for CPG products has been relentless throughout the pandemic and has accelerated in the first quarter of 2021.

Under the AI, all of these factors were to be considered together, with no specific factor or factors being considered more important than the others. Because of this, an employer would never be able to tell whether they had properly classified a worker as an employee or an independent contractor until the WHD made the determination. The AI was rescinded by the Trump DOL and replaced with a balanced regulation that ordered the various factors so that employers would be able to properly classify a worker as an employee or independent contractor.

Surveys showed that many previously exempt employees valued the flexible hours and work schedules that exempt status provided. Furthermore, because the rule applied to all employers, some charitable non-profits could not afford to keep employees working the same hours and would have been forced to reduce the services they provide. The regulation was eventually struck down by a federal judge in Texas who ruled that the new threshold was so high it rendered moot the salary test for exempt status. The Trump Administration’s DOL promulgated a new regulation establishing the current salary threshold of $35,568, a significant increase and a level the business community supports.

States and employers continue to struggle with labor shortages, increasing the difficulty of generating UI tax revenues. To counter this obstacle, the Chamber calls on Congress to support the reinstatement of the interest waiver which will allow states to address outstanding loans and interest payments without incurring more debt. Second, Congress appropriated $350 billion in State & Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) as part of ARPA for states to respond to the public health emergency. The Chamber urges states to use the SLFRF funds towards outstanding loans or accrued interest, or to replenish the state’s UI trust fund to pre-pandemic levels. States must be aware that per Treasury’s final rule, changes to a state’s maximum benefit entitlement are prohibited if SLFRF funds are used towards outstanding loans or interest payments.",

Small businesses are unable to receive assistance from the Small Business Administration. Companies are delayed in their ability to raise additional capital or complete the process of going public. The review of mergers and acquisitions is suspended. Companies ranging from manufacturers to brewers are unable to receive the approvals required by law to sell their products. Travelers are delayed. Processing of imports is hindered, and tariff exclusion requests are unprocessed. Safety inspectors are sidelined, mortgage approvals are delayed, and research is halted. National Parks are closed and trash at the parks is not being collected. Grants, contracts, and payments for goods and services already provided are delayed. Federal rulemakings are halted, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors go without pay.With each passing day, the situation will only get worse.Our broken immigration system is at the heart of the current impasse. While we are unlikely to solve all of our immigration problems at this point in time, there is a clear compromise that Republicans and Democrats can and should seize without delay.

One potential avenue is through a streamlined National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) review process. As it currently stands, it takes an average of 4.5 years for a NEPA decision to be made, with certain applications taking as much as 7 years to be approved.6 Compounding this timeline with the intensive process of building a new semiconductor facility, it could take a decade for these projects to come to fruition.

Huntsville has been selected as the newest site for a full-time program manager to support the HOH Corporate Fellowship Program and other recruitment resources for transitioning military service members.“Service men and women are proven leaders and team players with valuable skills that transfer easily into our economy,” said Lucia Cape, the Huntsville/Madison County Chamber’s senior vice president of economic development, industry relations, and workforce. “Hiring Our Heroes is not only a natural fit for our aerospace and defense companies, but also for our manufacturers in automotive, electronics and other precision industries.”As one of the fastest growing tech cities in the United States, Huntsville is projected to add more than 25,000 new jobs by the end of 2022 in aerospace, defense, manufacturing, construction, logistics, and technology. The demand to fill these roles with talent from the military community is high. Eric Eversole, president of Hiring Our Heroes and vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that program applicants have been showing interest in making Huntsville their post-military home for some time.“Hiring Our Heroes is committed to connecting these employers with top talent from the military community to fill in-demand roles. Expanding the Corporate Fellowship Program to Huntsville is an all-round win-win,” Eversole said.As part of the partnership, HOH has hired a full-time program manager, Preston Webb, who will be dedicated to connecting Huntsville companies with transitioning military talent. To learn more about hosting a fellow through the Huntsville CFP contact pwebb@uschamber.com.Corporate sponsors have priority access to the HOH resources and receive additional promotion within the program. Sponsorships are available through the Huntsville/Madison County Chamber by contacting Kristy Drake (kdrake@hsvchamber.org).Launched at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash., in 2015, the Corporate Fellowship Program(CFP) is a DoD SkillBridge program available to transitioning service members during their last 180 days of active duty. Through the program, fellows gain insight into developing careers with America’s most sought-after private sector organizations while, at the same time, connecting employers with much-needed top talent from the military community. The program has experienced unbridled success, growing from three locations in 2015 to more than 15 sites across 13 states and the District of Columbia.Approximately 1,261 service members completed fellowships in 2020 with more than 350 companies hosting fellows. The average salary for fellows who gained employment was over $90,000.",

As America’s recovery continues, we look forward to working with the Coalition partners to help more Black-owned small businesses grow and thrive.”The Coalition is a multi-year initiative launched by the U.S. Chamber Foundation and American Express in September 2020 to support the long-term success and resilience of Black-owned small businesses. The program is a first-of-its-kind collaboration with the nation’s four major Black chambers, including the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Business League, the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc., and Walker’s Legacy. Since its formation, AIG Foundation, Altice USA, and Dow have supported the program, with two new partners ADP and S&P Global Foundation having joined this year.In addition to the $5,000 grants, the Coalition will provide longer-term resources, such as mentorships, trainings, and additional enhancement funds. In partnership with Ureeka, each grantee will be paired with an industry specific mentor to help them further grow their business. Selected grantees will also have the opportunity to apply for $25,000 enhancement grants in Spring 2022 to help take their business to the next level.Within the program’s first year, the Coalition provided 600 grants to Black-owned businesses in 33 states. Business owners used those grants to catch up on monthly bills, increase payroll, or strengthen online marketing and more. Nearly 60% of last year’s cohort consistently engaged in the Coalition’s coaching offerings; the business owners who participated in those offerings experienced fewer financial losses in the first half of 2021 than those that did not. “The Coalition to Back Black Businesses $5,000 grant has allowed our business to purchase necessary medical equipment, office supplies, staffing, and increase our marketing and advertising reach,” said Melanie LaCour, owner of Alexandria Primary Care Clinic in Louisiana. “My mentors have given me the guidance and confidence needed to succeed and the enhancement grant will be used to hire additional staff, purchase specialty equipment, and improve access to services.”To be eligible for the grant program, businesses must meet certain criteria, including having between three and twenty full-time, part-time, or otherwise contracted employees, and must be located in an economically vulnerable community. Business owners can check their eligibility and express their interest in the program by filling out a short form on the Coalition’s website. The Coalition will invite eligible finalists to complete a full grant application, and more than 400 businesses will receive a $5,000 grant. Business owners will be notified of their status in mid-October. Businesses that are not selected to receive a grant are encouraged to apply again as the program will continue to run through 2024.",

Our success has been dependent upon the strength of public-private partnerships with organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Toyota. We are thrilled to present a new vehicle to Ernest Knight, a third-generation veteran, who proudly served in the U.S. Army,” said Adam Rocke, Senior Director of Events and Programs at Hiring Our Heroes.Originally from Portsmouth, Virginia, Knight, 31, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2013 and worked as a food service specialist. While he was deployed to Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom, Knight suffered an injury that ended his military career. He was honorably discharged at the rank of specialist in 2015. With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition. Knight was awarded the vehicle as a result of his winning entry into the annual Hiring Our Heroes’ Committed to America’s Heroes sweepstakes conducted late last year. The sweepstakes was open to all active duty, reserve and guard service members, veterans and military spouses and more than 85,000 entries were received.“Hiring Our Heroes and Toyota are working together to provide an opportunity for military families by offering valuable career development and training, online resources, and education. At DeLuca Toyota, we’ve been serving the North Central Florida community since 1978 and we’ve always taken an active role in supporting the community. We have several staff members that are veterans who have served our country. We are thrilled that this year’s sweepstakes winner is from the Ocala, Florida area,” said Frank DeLuca, owner and president of DeLuca Toyota.Knight has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Radford University and recently earned his master’s degree in criminal justice with an emphasis in critical incident management from Saint Leo University. Knight teaches Zumba at a local sport club. He is currently seeking full-time employment and exploring opportunities to help his fellow veterans pursue their education and career goals. He lives with his fiancé, Julio, in Ocala, Florida. “I am truly happy and grateful to receive a Toyota 4Runner from an organization like Hiring Our Heroes because they really care about veterans,” Knight said. “When you leave the military, it’s a scary thing because you have to adjust and transition to something else. It makes me feel good to know that Hiring Our Heroes is helping those that sacrificed so much for our country.”",

That bill, which the House of Representatives has already passed, would codify the Dynamex ABC test and apply it nationwide. California’s lawsuit and the PRO Act make clearwhat organized labor and its political allies want, even if it means undermining businesses that offer greater economic opportunity, not to mention a safe ride home.",

And even freelancers and independent contractors who voted “no” on a union would still be bound by all the wages and working conditions negotiated in a union contract because of the laws around exclusive representation.  Moreover, because these elections are decided by a majority of those who actually vote (and given the decentralized nature of independent contracting, many workers would be unlikely to even realize there’s an election) independent workers could easily be dragged into a union that only enjoyed minority support.",

As a result, millions of employees who had enjoyed flexible hours and professional status were converted to non-exempt status and put on the clock. Surveys showed that many previously exempt employees valued the flexible hours and work schedules that exempt status provided. Furthermore, because the rule applied to all employers, some charitable non-profits could not afford to keep employees working the same hours and would have been forced to reduce the services they provide. The regulation was eventually struck down by a federal judge in Texas who ruled that the new threshold was so high it rendered moot the salary test for exempt status. The Trump Administration’s DOL promulgated a new regulation establishing the current salary threshold of $35,568, a significant increase and a level the business community supports. We are concerned that Dr. Weil would again seek to unnecessarily raise this salary threshold.",

Prior to the pandemic, C_TEC released a report which showed that even as the number of data breaches increases, identity theft is holding at around the same levels. This is in part due to data being used to identify fraud and stop it in its tracks.2 We’ve also found that data used by the private sector is helping protect citizens from wildfires, promote financial inclusion, and enhance public safety.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars a year in illicit profit. All victims of trafficking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.Industry has an important role to play. Businesses cannot do this work alone. The business community needs to partner with governments and non-governmental organizations to address the scope of this problemBusinesses face an economic, legal, and reputational risk if they engage in human trafficking. The task force develops toolkits, hosts forums, and engages in advocacy work to shine a spotlight on this problem.According to the International Labor Organization, whereas 19% of victims are trafficked for commercial sex and make up a vast majority of illicit profits, incidences of forced labor are prevalent and widespread globally. To eradicate human trafficking, the task force addresses forced labor in supply chains and commercial sex trafficking.To conduct sex trafficking, traffickers rely on the transportation and hospitality sectors for moving and controlling victims, giving these sectors a critical role as the first line of defense.Regarding forced labor, repeal of the consumptive demand clause in 2016 heightened the need for businesses to be cognizant of labor risks.The financial sector also plays a role in eliminating forced labor. Since 2018, financial institutions such as banks have been required by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to identify and report suspicious activity related to human trafficking.Employers, in conjunction with social service providers, counseling firms, housing agencies, and skills-based training organizations, provide resources for human trafficking victims to heal. This work is done in conjunction with comprehensive social service providers and researchers.As the leading voice of business, the U.S. Chamber plays a critical role in addressing human trafficking. This report outlines activities that the task force has undertaken. These resources include a description of toolkits developed with partners; event summaries; and an overview of the U.S. Chamber’s lobbying and advocacy efforts.We hope that you will join us as we continue to grow this initiative.",

        "text": "OCALA, FL— The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s Hiring Our Heroes (HOH) presented U.S. Army veteran Ernest Knight with a 2021 Toyota 4Runner during today’s ceremony at the DeLuca Toyota dealership. “Hiring Our Heroes is proudly celebrating its tenth year of impact. Our success has been dependent upon the strength of public-private partnerships with organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Toyota. We are thrilled to present a new vehicle to Ernest Knight, a third-generation veteran, who proudly served in the U.S. Army,” said Adam Rocke, Senior Director of Events and Programs at Hiring Our Heroes.Originally from Portsmouth, Virginia, Knight, 31, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2013 and worked as a food service specialist. While he was deployed to Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom, Knight suffered an injury that ended his military career. He was honorably discharged at the rank of specialist in 2015. With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition. Knight was awarded the vehicle as a result of his winning entry into the annual Hiring Our Heroes’ Committed to America’s Heroes sweepstakes conducted late last year. The sweepstakes was open to all active duty, reserve and guard service members, veterans and military spouses and more than 85,000 entries were received.“Hiring Our Heroes and Toyota are working together to provide an opportunity for military families by offering valuable career development and training, online resources, and education. At DeLuca Toyota, we’ve been serving the North Central Florida community since 1978 and we’ve always taken an active role in supporting the community. We have several staff members that are veterans who have served our country. We are thrilled that this year’s sweepstakes winner is from the Ocala, Florida area,” said Frank DeLuca, owner and president of DeLuca Toyota.Knight has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Radford University and recently earned his master’s degree in criminal justice with an emphasis in critical incident management from Saint Leo University. Knight teaches Zumba at a local sport club. He is currently seeking full-time employment and exploring opportunities to help his fellow veterans pursue their education and career goals. He lives with his fiancé, Julio, in Ocala, Florida. “I am truly happy and grateful to receive a Toyota 4Runner from an organization like Hiring Our Heroes because they really care about veterans,” Knight said. “When you leave the military, it’s a scary thing because you have to adjust and transition to something else. It makes me feel good to know that Hiring Our Heroes is helping those that sacrificed so much for our country.”",

The disruption that this would cause for firms in this type of situation would have been significant. As such, this single concern drove many companies to not make use of the virtual verification option. Moreover, even for those companies that chose to take advantage of this flexibility during the height of the pandemic, a significant number of those companies discontinued using the virtual option to avoid potential liability for violations that could have arisen if they needed to verify their workers’ documentation in short order.",

Accordingly, if the PBGC determines that the continued operation of the plan somehow poses a financial risk to itself, the PBGC may impose as a condition of providing financial assistance that the plan be terminated. While ERISA states that minimum funding does not apply to a plan that terminates by mass withdrawal, there is no such provision relating to termination by plan amendment. Though the PBGC has opined that insolvent plans will continue to operate, there does appear to be at least a statutory mechanism through which a plan can be terminated without consent of the employer or even the trustees.

Indeed, if such a provision was necessary, it would have been included in the FAR previously and not left to USDA to create.

Its origins stretch back to the 1960s, and the rapid improvement of the technology has unlocked numerous applications across various industries. For instance, government applications include airline passenger facilitation and criminal investigations, and commercial applications include theft prevention in the retail industry, fraud detection, and automated photo tagging. Biometric facial verification, when done properly, is much more accurate than human facial verification. For example, passport officers are, at most, 80% accurate in matching passport photos to people, while facial algorithms are about 99% accurate for most traveler galleries. Given the diverse uses of the technology, a moratorium on federal use would create uncertainty and have a chilling effect on innovation throughout the facial recognition ecosystem. Further, it would undermine the implementation of a long-standing, bipartisan congressional mandate aimed at applying one of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report, namely, a biometrically enabled immigration exit system.",
