      "The Fight for $15 filed dozens of complaints on behalf of workers at McDonald’s franchises in 2012, and the NLRB General Counsel at the time, Richard Griffin, gladly prosecuted the case in the hopes of declaring McDonald’s to be a joint employer of the workers in question.  For their part, the NLRB Board members eased the way for such a finding by radically altering the legal standard for joint employment in the deeply flawed 2015 Browning-Ferris decision.",
      "A significant case at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) involving the McDonald’s Corporation has taken a new turn that could lead to a settlement that may be pretty worrisome for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).",
      "In a statement, the NLRB said the settlement “would avoid years of possible additional litigation” and deliver a “full remedy” for the employees in the cases.  Of course, that outcome is of little use to the SEIU, which has failed to sign up new members in its extensive campaign.  Unfortunately for the union, if the settlement goes through, it may soon realize that its multi-million dollar investment didn’t pay the dividends it had hoped for.",
      "The campaign against McDonald’s included the typical activities associated with union organizing drives, such as raucous demonstrations full of street-theater and protests outside of McDonalds’ shareholder conventions. Likewise, it also included using the levers of government to apply pressure, and sympathetic officials in the Obama NLRB were happy assist.",
      "That provision would affirm McDonald’s legal separation from its franchises and lessen the likelihood that the company would be held liable for alleged violations of labor law at franchises, which are typically owned by small businesses. Such a result would undermine the SEIU’s multi-year campaign against McDonald’s for which the union has “invested” millions of dollars.",
      "The NLRB’s General Counsel and McDonald’s told an administrative law judge on March 19 that they had agreed on the terms of the settlement.  The agreement reportedly included a provision that would avoid labeling McDonald’s Corporation as a joint employer of workers at independent franchise restaurants operating under the company’s brand.",
      "As observers of labor policy know, the SEIU has been the driving force (and principal funder) of a front group—the so-called worker center Fight for $15—that has targeted McDonald’s since 2012. In the ensuing years, the Fight for $15 has waged a campaign ostensibly to pressure McDonald’s into forcing its franchises to pay an inflated minimum wage of $15 per hour. The real prize for the SEIU, though, was the prospect of forcing those franchises to accept unionization, which would potentially provide the union with tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue from dues and initiation fees—hence the SEIU’s investment.",
      "Despite those efforts, the McDonald’s case slowly meandered through the NLRB’s adjudication process past the end of the Obama administration.

      "The Deputy Assistant Secretary for OSHA issued the walk-around letter to the Steelworkers union in response to an inquiry it had submitted.  That inquiry came in the form a letter from the union asking “whether workers at a workplace without a collective bargaining agreement may authorize a person who is affiliated with a union or a community organization to act as their representative” during OSHA inspections.",
      "For good measure, the letter finally offered that “workers in some situations may feel uncomfortable talking to an OSHA [inspector] without the trusted presence of a representative of their choosing.”  All of that, of course, was a thinly-veiled way of justifying the presence of a union organizer in order to facilitate unionizing efforts.",
      "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently reversed a controversial, albeit obscure, Obama-era policy that had opened the door for union organizers to accompany OSHA inspectors on visits to non-union workplaces.

      "Unionized workers typically are part of what’s called a multiemployer pension plan, and it works much differently than what most people are used to. Most workers today contribute some of their paycheck to a 401(k) account, money that is always theirs, and their employer makes a matching contribution that also belongs to the employee, generally after working three years. When the employee leaves, the account belongs to the employee to do what she wants with it.",

      "But there’s a bit of a problem.  The Pension Fund is considered in “critical” status by the federal government.  It is just 68.4% funded and has a nine-to-one ratio of retirees to active employees—meaning simply that more people are taking out than are putting in.  Finally, union pension plans typically have a five-year vesting window, in an industry where workers switch jobs frequently.  So a worker could put money in without a chance to take it out at retirement, unless they take a job at another company that is part of the same pension plan.",
      "Given the high costs associated with multiemployer plans that are in critical status and the risk that workers will see benefits that are less than contributions, assuming they actually meet the five-year vesting requirement, a much better solution would be for workers and employers to contribute to a 401(k) individual account that the employee owns.  But don’t expect unions to embrace that solution any time soon.",
      "Recently, this blog highlighted the continuing decline in union membership. There are likely many explanations for that decline. Nevertheless, unions have some selling points to recruit new members. One is the promise of a stable pension in retirement. But this promise doesn’t always bear out. Take, for example, the main pension plan of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RDSWU).",

      "For one thing, employers can expect a renewed emphasis on employees’ rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which protects so-called concerted activity among employees. An expansive reading of that section ensnared many an employer under the Obama-era NLRB, and the new general counsel seems poised to follow suit.",

Although these plans cover unionized workers, these plans are not union plans—they are jointly managed by employers and unions.",
      "Since peaking at roughly 35% of the workforce in the 1950s, union membership has steadily declined, and in 2017 it stood at just 10.7%, with a mere 6.5% membership rate in the private sector. Reversing this trend has been a longstanding priority for organized labor, but despite numerous efforts over the years the slide in membership has continued. An increasingly frustrated union movement has now launched its latest attempt, which involves a dramatic rewrite of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and other statutes. The crux of this endeavor is two pieces of legislation: the Workplace Democracy Act (S. 2810 and H.R. 5728, 115th Congress), introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and the Workers’ Freedom to Negotiate Act (S. 3064 and H.R. 6080, 115th Congress), introduced by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA)...",
      "Meanwhile, the legislature received enough backlash from individuals whose lives it had upended that it later passed legislation to provide dozens of exceptions for certain industries, which one might say is not the hallmark of well-made legislation in the first instance. However, it did no such thing for the gig economy companies that AB 5 had targeted.",
      "For their part, opponents of AB 5 began the effort to pass a ballot initiative to exempt app-based drivers and delivery workers from the law and thereby allow them to remain independent contractors. To be sure, organized labor, which was eager to unionize the thousands of workers who would be forced into employment relationships, campaigned vehemently against Proposition 22 with its usual overheated rhetoric, but in the end voters apparently were not swayed. Given the popularity of things like ridesharing and on-demand delivery, it seems that there are some limits to what the public will, or won’t, support just because labor leaders tell them to.",
      "It did not take very long after AB 5 went into effect this year for enforcement efforts to begin, and on May 5, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, as well as the city attorneys of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit against the popular rideshare companies  Uber and Lyft alleging that they were violating the law through their use of independent contractors who drive utilizing the companies’ rider-driver pairing technology. By October, the legal case seemed destined to go against the companies when the First District Court of Appeal, Division Four issued a 74-page opinion ordering them to classify drivers using their respective platforms as employees rather than independent contractors.",
      "In the days after an election, one can find countless articles analyzing the results of myriad races, and to be sure, this year is no exception. While some aspects of the 2020 election remain unresolved one item of interest in California was settled decisively. By a vote of 58.4% to 41.6%, voters in the Golden State passed a ballot measure—Proposition 22—which was a repudiation of the state legislature’s ill-conceived law known as AB 5.  As readers of this blog know, AB-5 sought to make the use of independent contractors in certain industries nearly impossible.",
      "Although Proposition 22 did not undo AB 5 altogether, by its terms drivers for app-based rideshare and delivery companies can remain independent contractors rather than employees provided that a company using their services do not set their hours, require the acceptance of specific ride or delivery requests, or restrict their ability to work for other companies.",
      "The passage of Proposition 22 culminates, at least in large part, a legal tug-of-war that has been happening for over two years. It began with the California Supreme Court, which in 2018 unilaterally changed its standard for interpreting whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor. The Court’s decision in a case known as Dynamex rewrote the existing law and adopted a modified “ABC” test for evaluating an employment relationship.  The ABC test is known as such because it uses three factors (A,B, and C) to evaluate an independent contractor relationship.  Flunk any one of the three factors and a worker becomes an employee.  Critically, Dynamex  removed an important element of Part B of the test that had facilitated business relationships with independent contractors in other states using an ABC test of their own.",
      "Not to be outdone, the state legislature, at the urging of organized labor, decided to codify the DynamexABC test in 2019, which it did by passing AB 5. The upshot of the revised test was that it became much harder for someone to be classified legally as an independent contractor, leaving employers either to assume all of the liability associated with an employer-employee relationship or to stop using the services of independent contractors who did not meet AB 5’s stringent test.",

      "Fourth and finally, any proposed change should enable, and not inhibit, the growth of the internet economy, which encompasses applications, business models, and sectors across the entire internet ecosystem. The internet economy is essential to continued U.S. global competitiveness and to providing critical services and products to consumers. The Department of Commerce estimates that the output of the U.S. digital economy exceeded $2 trillion in 2019, a $700 billion increase from 2010 (28). In fact, the internet economy grew seven times faster than the overall U.S. economy over the last four years (29). The number of jobs supported by internet related activities is estimated at 3 million in the U.S. alone (30). Many of these gains can be attributed to new business models and innovations, ranging from social media, e-commerce, the gig economy, and business to business providers.",
      "There is a path forward on a minimum wage increase that would benefit employees and employers, and the Chamber looks forward to working with members of Congress to strike the right balance and develop a legislative package that responsibly increases the federal minimum wage.

      "Nonetheless, an NLRB hearing officer issued a report recommending that the results of the April election be overturned, effectively invalidating the nearly 1,800 votes against union representation.  Adding insult to injury, the primary justification for this was that the United States Postal Service (USPS) had installed a mailbox on the premises of Amazon’s facility at the company’s request, in order to—stop the presses—make it easier for workers to cast a ballot.  Perhaps it’s naïve to think that the facilitation of voting is an important part of an NLRB-supervised election.",
      "It is not much of a secret that the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) would really, really like to be the collective bargaining representative of Amazon’s Bessemer employees, and it has devoted considerable resources to that end, including an angry emoji for good measure.",
      "On November 29, an NLRB Regional Director issued a decision supporting the conclusion of the hearing officer that the nefarious mailbox had tainted the election.  No date for a rerun has been set (and there’s no word yet if this decision will be appealed to the full NLRB).  However, it’s quite possible that all the histrionics will be in vain.  The union has yet to make a case for itself any more compelling than that which was already decisively rejected in April.  If a similar outcome results again, hopefully the union—and the NLRB—will realize that “no” really does mean “no.”",
      "The problem for the RWDSU, however, is that despite all of its organizing efforts, when Amazon’s employees had their say—after all, it’s supposedly up to them—they voted overwhelmingly against the union last April.  Indeed, the vote was not even close: the RWDSU lost by a vote of 738 votes for the union versus 1,798 votes against it.  Notwithstanding 505 challenged ballots, the results were, ahem, decisive.",
      "An old saying goes that if at first one doesn’t succeed, one should try and try again, which is generally good advice. For labor unions that can’t take “no” for an answer, though, it sometimes translates into getting the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to tilt the scales until the “right” outcome results, which doesn’t exactly suggest good public policy. Nevertheless, that’s precisely the strategy the union trying to organize an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama appears to be employing.",
      "In November 2013, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce published a Working Paper, The Emerging Role of Worker Centers in Union Organizing: A Strategic Assessment, which examined the complex relationship between worker centers and traditional labor unions, and delineated the extensive funding of the worker center movement by activist foundations during the period 2009-2012. The present essay reviews that analysis in the light of subsequent developments, and, using data from public filings and reports covering the period 2013-2016, brings forward our examination of the mechanisms by which the labor movement and the philanthropic community support this form of organizing.​..",
      "The situation is a direct result of the misguided—to be polite—decisions of certain public officials who seem to know little about running a business.  As this blog has reported in the past, the California legislature in 2019 passed a law known as AB 5, which deliberately redefined the standard for determining whether an individual may be classified as an independent contractor rather than employee.",
      "Of course, such a reclassification would have other consequences that those same politicians blithely dismiss. The negative impact of AB 5 has been well-established, as individuals in numerous industries looking for flexibility in their work—or any work during a pandemic for that matter—face the loss of their very livelihoods. For their part, consumers who have grown used to the convenience of ridesharing, delivery, and other innovative services made possible by the technological savvy of the people who founded Lyft and Uber and other app-based companies could suddenly be forced to use less attractive options, assuming such options are available.",
      "That legislation codified an equally misguided decision by the California Supreme Court known as Dynamex in which that court first modified what is known as the “ABC” test for evaluating an employment relationship. Under part “B” of a typical ABC test, a business can usually satisfy that element if the work being performed is done outside of all physical locations of the business in question, such as in one’s own vehicle.  In contrast, California’s peculiar version of the ABC test is intended to make it harder to classify someone as an independent contractor by removing that qualification and saying services provided by an independent contractor must be “outside the usual course of business” of the hiring entity.",
      "After AB 5 took effect in January, it did not take long for politicians of a certain stripe to assail Uber and Lyft, arguing the companies were misclassifying drivers who use those platforms to find customers.  A lawsuit soon followed.  On August 10, San Francisco-based Judge Ethan P. Schulman ruled against the rideshare companies, but he stayed his ruling for ten days to allow time for an appeals court to intervene if it so chose, which thankfully it did. In the meantime, the companies’ CEOs will have to certify to the appeals court that in the event their appeal fails to overturn Judge Schulman’s ruling, they can comply with AB 5 within 30 days.  However, the appeals court also noted that a pending ballot initiative may exempt gig companies from AB-5, which if it passes would make the litigation moot.",
      "The prospect of companies like Uber and Lyft suspending—or ultimately ending—their operations in California would seem to belie the Golden State’s reputation as a haven for innovative technology companies.  That possibility—made real by the state’s lawsuit—seemed to hit home, as San Diego’s Republican mayor and San Jose’s Democrat mayor issued a statement asking the appellate court to stay the lower court ruling. Apparently, they comprehend that it might not be good to “shut down an industry that’s vital to the income and livelihood of millions.”",
      "Unfortunately, there is more at play in the effort against gig-economy companies.  Behind much of it is organized labor, which has sought any way possible to reverse its six-plus decade membership decline. Since independent contractors cannot unionize, successfully reclassifying drivers for rideshare companies as employees could open the door for organizing efforts to that end. The politicians whom unions lavish with support got the message.",

That’s because the state is threatening the viability in California of two of its biggest success stories, rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. The two businesses are embroiled in a judicial struggle to maintain their business model in California, and the ongoing dispute almost resulted in the firms shutting down operations in the state. An order by a California appeals court spared the millions of people in California, both drivers and customers, who use their services from that fate—at least for now.",

      "That flawed—and cynical—assessment has led to an all-out assault on companies in the so-called gig economy that offer platforms for customers to procure goods and services from individuals willing to provide them for predetermined fees or rates. For example, as this blog reported last month, the California attorney general and several city attorneys filed a lawsuit against Uber and Lyft alleging that the pair of gig economy companies are violating state law through their use of independent contractors who utilize the companies’ technology.",
      "In a similar vein, the San Francisco district attorney last week announced—via Twitter—that he was initiating a lawsuit against another gig company, DoorDash, alleging it was engaged in unfair business practices “for illegally misclassifying employees as independent contractors.” In a press conference, he also said this lawsuit was just a “first step,” which will be managed by the Economic Crimes Against Workers Unit run by Assistant District Attorney Scott Stillman, adding ominously, “I did not bring ADA Stillman into the office to file one lawsuit.”",
      "The state of California demonstrates its reluctance to foster a good business environment on a regular basis and with seeming alacrity, and one bugaboo du jour among the Golden State’s policymakers is the area of alleged misclassification of independent contractors. The upshot of their position is that employers deliberately fail to categorize such contractors as employees to avoid the extra costs and liability that attach to an employer-employee relationship.",
      "Whether or not politicians passed AB 5 to facilitate union organizing at gig-economy companies, there is hardly any question that the law’s new standard has upended countless individuals’ lives and livelihoods. In doing so, the law defies common sense by assuming every user of platforms like DoorDash, Uber, and Lyft is—or wants to be—an employee of those companies. More importantly, should the crusade against supposed misclassification continue, it remains to be seen whether such gig-economy companies can even continue doing business in a state known for its high-tech industry. How ironic.",
      "The complaint against Uber and Lyft alleges that the companies are violating California’s relatively new, controversial law known as AB 5 that redefines the standard for classifying independent contractors. In contrast, the suit against DoorDash further argues that the company is in violation of section 17200 of the state Business and Professions Code, which defines “unfair competition” as “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act,” due to its failure to abide by AB 5. As such, the company could be slapped with a $2,500 civil penalty for each violation.",
      "In addition to civil penalties, the lawsuit against DoorDash seeks “restitution” in the form of back wages allegedly owed as well as an injunction barring the company from continuing to classify so-called Dashers, who deliver food using the platform, as independent contractors. In an apparent coincidence, the California attorney general reportedly has asked the court hearing the case against Uber and Lyft for a preliminary injunction as well, all of which could cease the companies’ operations in the state if the injunctions are granted.",
      "While the rhetoric surrounding these lawsuits is couched in terms of alleged misclassification as it relates to California labor law, one can be forgiven for concluding that the state’s AB 5 standard has more to do with the wishes of organized labor, which supported the legislation to say the least. The reason for that is simple enough: membership in labor unions, which independent contractors cannot join, has been declining for decades.",

Nor does it contain a carve-out that would allow labor unions to use pre-dispute arbitration to resolve their disputes while denying the use of arbitration to others. Arbitration provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court. Empirical studies demonstrate that employees in arbitration do just as well, or in many circumstances, considerably better, than in court. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the flexibility of arbitration served complainants and businesses alike well as arbitration cases proceeded on schedule, while courthouses were forced to close their doors and developed significant backlogs that still present a challenge today.",

      "The NLRA currently does not have jurisdiction over independent contractors. Under the PRO Act, independent contractors could be deemed employees for purposes of federal labor law, which would allow unions to organize them and negotiate over their wages and working conditions—and collect dues from them.",
      "The PRO Act would amend the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and use the ABC test to define employment under that law, which governs the relationship between employers, employees, and labor unions. Unlike AB-5, which only applies to California, the PRO Act would apply the ABC test to all 50 states for the first time ever.",
      "The upshot will be that a handful of workers can make a decision that would drastically change working conditions for potentially thousands of independent contractors and freelancers—not just those who “choose to join a union.”",

      "No. The PRO Act would make it far more difficult, and in some cases impossible, for workers to decertify an unwanted union.",
      "Moreover, union elections under the NLRA are decided by a majority of the percentage of workers that actually vote. In many cases, this is less than a majority of all the workers impacted. With independent contractors, this problem will be magnified because by their very nature, independent contractors and freelancers are dispersed. Many may not realize a union election is actually taking place.",
      "Should the PRO Act pass, businesses will be reluctant to take on independent contractors who could end up in a union, or for whom the business must accept an employer-employee relationship where one does not currently exist. This will limit earning opportunities for these workers.",
      "No. The reality is that the PRO Act would apply California’s ABC test to all 50 states (and without the dozens of exemptions that California had to enact once the impact of the ABC test became clear). That alone is a dramatic change, and it would be the first time the federal government has adopted this restrictive ABC test.",
      "If the ABC test were the only change to the law, perhaps. But other parts of the PRO Act mean that the impact on independent contractors and freelancers will not be limited just to those who “choose to join a union.” For example, the PRO Act eliminates right-to-work laws, so that any independent contractor or freelancer pulled into a union would be forced to pay union fees or lose their job.",

All of that could change, though, because the state of California has decided to wage yet another battle against technology companies that make such life-saving options possible.",
      "As this blognotedat the time the decision came down, the California Supreme Court’s Dynamex standard may put many employers’ entire business model in jeopardy, and the state’s lawsuit against Uber and Lyft underscores the point.  Especially in the middle of the current economic crisis, that’s hardly something to celebrate, but what makes things even worse is the Democrat-backedProtecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. That bill, which the House of Representatives has already passed, would codify the Dynamex ABC test and apply it nationwide. California’s lawsuit and the PRO Act make clearwhat organized labor and its political allies want, even if it means undermining businesses that offer greater economic opportunity, not to mention a safe ride home.",

      "For example, would a contractor be required to report a violation under OSHA if a citation had been challenged at the administrative law judge level (the first level of adjudication) but the company intended to appeal it further to the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and then to federal court? If a company settles an OSHA violation noted during an inspection but files a notification for modification of abatement, is that deemed a reportable event under the proposed AGAR clause? If the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (that enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act) declines to proceed with a discrimination charge but the employee has not acted on their Notice of Right to Sue, would that be considered adjudicated? Or what is the status if a charge is settled or mediated before any agency determination? Similarly, what level of adjudication triggers reporting of an unfair labor practice charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board? ULPs are a frequent pressure tactic of unions when seeking to unionize a company or during contract negotiations. Furthermore, every statute cited in the list of reportable labor law violations has its own investigation, enforcement and remedial provision to be enforced by a government agency or a private allegedly aggrieved individual or party. Thus, there is no void left to be filled by superimposing a non-related procurement obligation on top of an already long-standing and legally defined enforcement process for labor and employment laws dating back to the 1930’s.

The decision remands the issue to the NLRB—now run by a Democratic majority—and opens the door for a policy reversal that will hamstring employers.",
      "An administrative law judge sided with the musicians under precedent set by New York New York, a 2011 NLRB decision holding that a property owner may lawfully exclude employees of a contractor who usually work on the premises “only where the owner is able to demonstrate that their activity significantly interferes with his use of the property or where exclusion is justified by another legitimate business reason.”",
      "As a general rule, Section 7 limits an employer’s ability to restrict its own employees from engaging in labor-related activities during non-work hours and in non-work areas of its property. On the other hand, employers have greater flexibility to exclude non-employees even if they are engaging in labor organizing activities. Excluding non-employees who work for a contractor on an employer’s premises presents a third scenario that the NLRB’s 2019 decision addressed.",
      "On appeal to the D.C. Circuit, the musicians’ union challenged the NLRB’s dismissal of its complaint. Siding with the union, the court dissected various elements of the Bexarstandard and concluded, “the Board's decision is arbitrary in the way that it implements its new standard for determining when a property owner may prohibit an onsite contractor's employees from conducting labor organizing activity on the premises.” With the current NLRB majority of like mind, the seemingly inevitable result will be the adoption of a standard that once again will restrict employers’ ability to limit unwarranted labor activity on their private property.",
      "The question of employers’ private property rights dates to the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) itself in 1935.  Section 7 of the NLRA guarantees “the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations . . . and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.” Whereas an employer generally has the right to exclude individuals from its premises—just as any other property owner does—the protections under Section 7 can conflict with that right.

Despite losing 391,000 jobs in 2020, the public sector saw union membership increase by about 107,000 that year over 2019.  In 2021, however, the number employed in the public sector dipped slightly (by about 6,000), but union membership fell by about 181,000, almost a full percentage point from 34.8% to 33.9%.",
      "The 10.8% membership rate in 2020 was up from 10.3%, but it was skewed by the loss of 9.6 million jobs, most of which were non-union. Despite the rate increase that year, union membership in whole numbers dropped by 321,000. While the union membership rate in 2021 returned percentagewise to where it had been in 2019, the number of union members fell another roughly 230,000.",

This year’s report showed that union membership as a percentage of the workforce declined by half a percentage point from 10.8% to 10.3%, a drop that matches the lowest level on record set in 2019. As this blog observed about last year’s report, there is a little more to the story due to the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "This year’s union membership report leaves much to be desired for organized labor leaders, to say the least.  Indeed, it demonstrates yet another decline in a downward trend dating to 1955.  Factoring out public sector unions, of which there were few, if any, back then, the decline amounts to about an 82% drop in union membership. Of course, public sector unions do exist, but the point is organized labor would be even more emaciated without them.",

There is currently a shortfall of more than $124 billion in these plans.

      "What makes this situation worse is the fact that employees at the JFK8 facility are about to have a union representation election, and the NLRB’s sudden demand for an injunction seems dubiously timed to sway voters.",
      "In none of that intervening time—not to mention any time prior— had the NLRB sought an injunction regarding the terminated employee. Yet, just as ballots are about to be cast, the agency maintains that Amazon should be forced not only to rehire the terminated employee (even if it means firing someone else), but also post copies of the court’s order (should it issue one)—both in English and Spanish—“in all breakrooms, bathrooms, and bathroom stalls” at Amazon’s JFK8 facility. It also asked the court to require Amazon to hold one or more mandatory employee meetings at which company management would read the court’s order aloud.  It seems obvious that all of this would paint Amazon in a less than flattering light.  The NLRB frequently cites employers for disturbing the “laboratory conditions” it seeks to maintain during an election.  The agency is not supposed to disturb those conditions itself.",
      "On March 17, an NLRB Regional Director filed a petition in federal court seeking an injunction under Section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The petition asked the court to force Amazon to rehire an employee who had been fired from his job at the company’s fulfillment center in Staten Island, NY (known as its JFK8 facility). Despite the drama of using 10(j), this termination was hardly an emergency, in fact it took place a full 23 months ago.",
      "Despite its ostensible role as a neutral arbiter, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has a penchant for tilting the field in favor of labor unions depending on who is running the agency. Its most recent shenanigan involving the retail giant Amazon—a curiously-timed court petition— is an unfortunate example of this phenomenon.",
      "According to the NLRB, Amazon’s decision to fire the employee was illegal because it violated the NLRA’s protection of concerted activity, as the employee was engaged in protests over Amazon’s COVID-19 policies. Amazon maintains that the employee was terminated because he “publicly, viciously, and profanely berated a female coworker over a bullhorn and social media broadcasts,” which it called a “vile, offensive, and disparaging verbal attack … that no employer ever would—or should—tolerate or accept in a civilized workplace.” According to at least one news report about the language used, Amazon’s characterization would seem pretty accurate.",
      "As observers of labor policy know, the NLRB has a questionable record when it comes to employer policies such as requiring civility in the workplace. During the Obama administration, the NLRB attacked such policies and deemed them illegal. In those days, the Board believed that requiring courtesy in the workplace interfered with organizing rights, and it seems the current Board is taking the same view.",
      "The NLRB has a history of this type of behavior, such as when the Board tried to force the Cooper Tire & Rubber Company to rehire a worker who had used ethnic slurs on the picket line.  Apparently, the NLRB has now come full circle and thinks that “disparaging verbal attacks” should be an acceptable part of the workplace environment.  Someone might want to alert the EEOC.",

After all, while Fight for $15 has achieved some policy successes, convincing a number of cities and even a few states to institute a $15 an hour minimum wage, it has failed utterly in its main objective of unionizing the fast food industry.  In fact, the SEIU has spent at least $72 million on the campaign according to reports filed with the Department of Labor and has yet to file a single organizing petition.",
      "As readers of this blog are well aware, the Fight for $15 campaign has created quite a few headlines over the past five years.

      "Moreover, a key piece of the effort is now in jeopardy.  To make it easier to unionize fast food, the SEIU advocated for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to expand the definition of joint employer, which the agency did in the 2015 Browning Ferris decision.  That decision could have allowed the SEIU to unionize a company like McDonald’s in one fell swoop rather than having to go franchise by franchise across the country.

      "By electronic submission: www.regulations.govRE: Independent Contractor Status Under the Fair Labor Standards Act: Delay of Effective Date; RIN 1235–AA34; 86 Fed. Reg. 8326 (February 5, 2021)",
      "The ultimate inquiry is whether, as a matter of economic reality, the worker is dependent on a particular individual, business, or organization for work (and is thus an employee) or is in business for him- or herself (and is thus an independent contractor).",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce enthusiastically supported the final regulation describing how to classify a worker as an independent contractor or an employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act that was published in the Federal Register on January 7, 2021. We believe the regulation sets out a very balanced analysis that respects the interests of all parties. Accordingly, we oppose the Wage and Hour Division’s proposed extension of the effective date to May 7, 2021 and believe the regulation should go in to effect as originally planned on March 8, 2021.",
      "The DOL’s sole reason for proposing to delay the final regulation on independent contractors is inaccurate, and cannot justify the proposed additional delay. The Federal Register notice claims that the regulation adopts a “new legal standard.” (86 Fed. Reg. 8327, February 5, 2",
      "The Department’s notice proposing postponement of the independent contractor status under the FLSA regulation’s effective date is substantively deficient, inherently contradictory, and ignores instructions from OMB about when such postponement is appropriate. Accordingly, the Department should not postpone the effective date and the regulation should go into effect on March 8, 2021 as originally announced.",
      "The Department asserts in its proposed effective date extension that the final regulation “would adopt a new legal standard for determining employee and independent contractor status under the FLSA,” (86 Fed. Reg. 8327) yet fails to explain how the economic realities test at the heart of the regulation is a new legal standard. Absent supporting explanation, this claim cannot serve as the basis for postponing the effective date by 60 days.",

      "The union front group Fight for $15 was at it again this week with demonstrations against its perennial target, the McDonald’s Corporation, which is hosting its annual shareholders meeting.  However, after boasting of a large-scale protest, the so-called March on McDonald’s did not exactly live up to its organizers’ hype, which could mean that the budget cuts at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) are starting to have an impact.",

      "Indeed, as this blog recounted on a few occasions, many of the independent contractors that AB 5 purportedly sought to protect had their careers—not to mention their lives—upended because of the law.  That’s because businesses had to choose whether or not they could bear the costs and liabilities of having an employment relationship with their erstwhile independent contractors, which led many to sever ties after concluding that they could not.",

A great majority (84%) agreed that Proposition 22 is a better alternative than forcing drivers into a traditional employee relationship, while almost as many also agreed having more of a safety net is also better.  Over 80% also said they enjoy the flexibility and independence that comes with being an independent contractor.",
      "Six months later, new polling information suggests that Californians who work as independent contractors maintain their support for that decision.  An independent research firm, Benneson Strategy Group, surveyed delivery people who have driven using the Uber or Uber Eats platform since January 2021 to gauge their sentiment, and the results were quite clear.",
      "The AB 5 bill codified a dubious “ABC” test that made classifying an individual as an independent contractor significantly more difficult. This test was first adopted by the state supreme court’s decision in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles.  Despite the judicial and legislative actions, however, public sentiment does not appear to support these ideological diktats.",
      "The damage caused by AB 5 was so extensive that the California legislature was forced to pass bills exempting industry after industry before the proverbial ink was dry.  After a concerted effort by the business community and countless independent contractors who organized themselves against AB 5, California voters had their say in November 2020, when they passed Proposition 22, which provides that drivers for app-based rideshare and delivery companies may remain independent contractors rather than employees if certain conditions are met.",
      "As observers of labor policy know, unions and their allies have undertaken a concerted effort in recent years to undermine independent contracting, and that effort has led to misguided policies like California’s notorious legislation known as AB 5, the ramifications of which are still unfolding.",
      "In the days after an election, one can find countless articles analyzing the results of myriad races, and to be sure, this year is no exception. While some aspects of the 2020 election remain unresolved one item of interest in California was settled decisively. By a vote of 58.4% to 41.6%, voters in the Golden State passed a ballot measure—Proposition 22—which was a repudiation of the state legislature’s ill-conceived law known as AB 5.  As readers of this blog know, AB-5 sought to make the use of independent contractors in certain industries nearly impossible.",
      "Not to be outdone, the state legislature, at the urging of organized labor, decided to codify the DynamexABC test in 2019, which it did by passing AB 5. The upshot of the revised test was that it became much harder for someone to be classified legally as an independent contractor, leaving employers either to assume all of the liability associated with an employer-employee relationship or to stop using the services of independent contractors who did not meet AB 5’s stringent test.",
      "The passage of Proposition 22 culminates, at least in large part, a legal tug-of-war that has been happening for over two years. It began with the California Supreme Court, which in 2018 unilaterally changed its standard for interpreting whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor. The Court’s decision in a case known as Dynamex rewrote the existing law and adopted a modified “ABC” test for evaluating an employment relationship.  The ABC test is known as such because it uses three factors (A,B, and C) to evaluate an independent contractor relationship.  Flunk any one of the three factors and a worker becomes an employee.  Critically, Dynamex  removed an important element of Part B of the test that had facilitated business relationships with independent contractors in other states using an ABC test of their own.",
      "For their part, opponents of AB 5 began the effort to pass a ballot initiative to exempt app-based drivers and delivery workers from the law and thereby allow them to remain independent contractors. To be sure, organized labor, which was eager to unionize the thousands of workers who would be forced into employment relationships, campaigned vehemently against Proposition 22 with its usual overheated rhetoric, but in the end voters apparently were not swayed. Given the popularity of things like ridesharing and on-demand delivery, it seems that there are some limits to what the public will, or won’t, support just because labor leaders tell them to.",
      "Although Proposition 22 did not undo AB 5 altogether, by its terms drivers for app-based rideshare and delivery companies can remain independent contractors rather than employees provided that a company using their services do not set their hours, require the acceptance of specific ride or delivery requests, or restrict their ability to work for other companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the legislature received enough backlash from individuals whose lives it had upended that it later passed legislation to provide dozens of exceptions for certain industries, which one might say is not the hallmark of well-made legislation in the first instance. However, it did no such thing for the gig economy companies that AB 5 had targeted.",
      "It did not take very long after AB 5 went into effect this year for enforcement efforts to begin, and on May 5, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, as well as the city attorneys of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit against the popular rideshare companies  Uber and Lyft alleging that they were violating the law through their use of independent contractors who drive utilizing the companies’ rider-driver pairing technology. By October, the legal case seemed destined to go against the companies when the First District Court of Appeal, Division Four issued a 74-page opinion ordering them to classify drivers using their respective platforms as employees rather than independent contractors.",

On the spending side, the SEIU disbursed approximately $314 million, also a drop of more than $100 million since 2012.",
      "While spending may have dipped overall, the union continued to shell out large sums for its Fight for $15 campaign.  In 2016, $14 million was devoted to the cause, bringing the total since the campaign was launched to nearly $70 million (this is a very conservative estimate, the actual total is likely to be significantly higher).",
      "The question for dues-paying SEIU members is just what the union is getting for this largesse.  Certainly Fight for $15 has achieved a few policy successes in terms of raising the minimum wage in some states and localities.  But in its central purpose—the unionization of the fast food industry—the campaign has led to no new union members.  In fact, SEIU membership has gone down since Fight for $15 started.  Still, the SEIU had hopes that policies pushed by a friendly administration, namely forcing franchisors into joint employment relationships with franchisees, would provide fuel for the campaign.  The election of Donald Trump is likely to bring an end to that prospect once new National Labor Relations Board members are installed and reexamine the previous Board’s",

The rationale seemed to be that if large corporate franchisors could be made a joint employer, then a successful organizing campaign at a single franchise could force it to the bargaining table.  Once there, the SEIU could then attempt to negotiate national card check and/or neutrality agreements covering all franchisees, which subsequently could be quickly picked off.",

      "This issue crept up about five years ago, when the SEIU created the Fight for $15 and began a series of raucous protests at fast food restaurants.  The objective of these protests ostensibly was a minimum wage of $15 per hour and union representation in the fast food industry, starting with well-known brands like McDonald’s.

Reg. 14034) The Chamber believes this view ismisguided and presumes conclusions that the regulation does not guarantee.",
      "In WHD’s view, the preferred environment is the status quo ante where employers areuncertain how to classify a worker under the economic realities test because they can not knowhow WHD will evaluate the different factors. That lack of clarity and certainty puts employersat risk of WHD enforcement and private litigation, and can impede businesses from engagingmany smaller businesses or sole proprietors. For this reason, as well as others identified in ourcomments to the proposed regulation (attached), the Chamber urges the WHD to withdraw thisproposed rescission and allow the Independent Contractor Status under the FLSA regulation totake effect as currently scheduled on May 7, 2021.",
      "The regulation provided structure to the economic realities test that had been used bycourts for decades. The economic realities (or economic dependence) test enumerated six factors“typically articulated by WHD previously: (1) The nature and degree of the employer’s control;(2) the permanency of the worker’s relationship with the employer; (3) the amount of theworker’s investment in facilities, equipment, or helpers; (4) the amount of skill, initiative,judgment, and foresight required for the worker’s services; (5) the worker’s opportunities forprofit or loss; and (6) the extent of the integration of the worker’s services into the employer’sbusiness. ” (86 Fed. Reg. 14030, quoting WHD Opinion Letter FLSA 2019 -6, citations omitted)The key to the independent contractor regulation was to change the analysis from one where allthe factors were given equal weight and no one factor was considered dominant, to one wherethe factors were given specific weight leading to greater consistency and predictability fordetermining the status of workers.",

This has led toconsiderable amounts of litigation and other legal actions that the Chamber believeswould be reduced by the clarity and definitive nature of the Proposed Rule.In the Proposed Rule, the Department has provided a contemporary interpretationof the economic realities test that has been long relied upon to determine whether aworker should be classified as an employee or an independent contractor under the FLSA. The Chamber believes the Proposed Rule … properly focuses on modern,understandable, and meaningful factors. This would benefit workers, consumers,entrepreneurs, independent artists, writers and creators, sole proprietors, businesses of allsizes, and the overall economy.",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce enthusiastically supported the final regulationdescribing how to classify a worker as an independent contractor or an employee under the FairLabor Standards Act that was published in the Federal Register on January 7, 2021. We believethe regulation sets out a very balanced analysis that respects the interests of all parties.Accordingly, we oppose d the Wage and Hour Division’s extension of the effective date to May7, 2021 and similarly oppose this proposed rescission of the independent contractor regulation.",
      "Amending the NLRA to include civil penalties would fundamentally overturn 85 years of precedent. For employers, fines could range from $50,000 to $100,000 for each charge of unfair labor practices. That’s over and above any actual injuries claimed by workers or unions.",
      "Congress passed the NLRA in 1935, forming the core of U.S. labor law. Congress deliberately avoided punitive measures, such as civil penalties, against either labor or management. In Republic Steel v. NLRB, the Supreme Court held in 1940 that Congress intended the act to be a remedial law focused on making employees whole, not a punitive one designed to penalize employers should they (knowingly or unknowingly) violate it.",
      "The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO, is a radical piece of legislation that would rewrite our nation’s labor laws in at least 51 different ways. Passed by the House earlier this year, the bill has 47 co-sponsors in the Senate, all Democrats. Unions and their allies aren’t waiting for more support. Instead, they are determined to change the National Labor Relations Act by inserting the penalty provisions of the PRO Act into the $3.5 trillion budget bill.",
      "Strongly oppose the amendment offered by Rep. Capuano that strikes Section 628 of the bill that would prohibit the SEC from promulgating a political spending disclosure rule.

The Chamber will consider including votes related to this amendment in our annual How They Voted scorecard.",
      "Technology is changing how we connect to each other, solving complex challenges with data, and making transportation safer. Technology is expanding—not replacing—opportunities for Americans to work, granting them flexibility via new work models in the gig economy, expanding the job pool through the creation of data centers, and helping workers train and develop new skills. America’s technology sector accounts for 6.5% of total U.S. GDP, directly employs 5.9 million works and indirectly supports 33.8 million jobs.1 As more traditional companies embrace technologies and become technology companies themselves, they too will enable economic and job growth. In order for the U.S. to reap the benefits of the 21st century technology workforce, the U.S. Chamber’s Technology Engagement Center (“C_TEC”) believes that policymakers must 1) embrace innovative and flexible work structures to power the gig economy; 2) modernize the nation’s immigration laws; 3) partner with the private sector to upskill America’s workforce; and 4) encourage the deployment of data centers.",
      "Under ARPA, a plan that receives SFA will be considered to be in critical status through the 2051 plan year. A plan that is in critical status must have a rehabilitation plan that provides for a reduction in future benefit accruals and/or an increase in contributions so that the plan may emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period (i.e. 10 years or longer if a plan cannot emerge within 10 years).6 Special rules apply between the period the plan is certified as critical and before the rehabilitation plan is adopted by an employer in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). During this time, the trustees cannot accept a CBA that provides for a reduction in the level of contributions for any participant, a suspension of contribution with regard to any period of service or any new or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees from plan participation.7 These restrictions do not apply after the rehabilitation plan is adopted. After the first year, the trustees must annually update the rehabilitation plan, including updating the schedule of contributions rates to reflect the plan experience.",
      "A narrow interpretationof the Program and overreaching conditions that negatively impact contributing employers will not help the long-term viability of these plans. If the amount of the SFA is interpreted narrowly such that the plans would otherwise become insolvent in 2051, employers will face the option of withdrawing now or waiting until 2051 when the plan inevitably goes insolvent. As many employers are at the point, or will be soon, where withdrawal liability now is the cheaper option, there is no incentive to remain in the plan when remaining in the plan will only extend the duration of future withdrawal liability payments. In addition, unions will have no reason to push for continuation of these plans when the retired or soon to be retired employees are protected until approximately 2051 by the SFA, and the younger active employees know they will receive little or nothing for their pension contributions because the plan is sure to be insolvent before or shortly after they retire.",
      "If the SFA is only going to extend solvency to 2051, and then leave these plans to go insolvent and reduce benefits to the PBGC maximum, there is also no reason for unions to push for the continuance of these plans.",
      "In 2019, Assemblywoman Gonzalez introduced AB 5, which deliberately omitted the second element dealing with the location of the work performed, and the implication was immediately clear: businesses that procure the services of individuals who never even step foot into the business’s physical location could no longer rely on that fact to classify someone as an independent contractor.",
      "Under the typical ABC test, employers must satisfy all three parts to classify someone as an independent contractor. Importantly, the “B” prong states that one can be considered an independent contractor if “the service is performed either outside the usual course of the business for which it is performed or is performed outside of all places of business of the enterprise for which it is performed.”",

      "To be fair, AB 5’s modified ABC test was first articulated by the California Supreme Court the prior year, but once it became a law, it applied to all employers across the state, many of whom relied on independent contractors in a wide range of businesses.  As a result, AB 5 cast into doubt many longstanding relationships.",
      "More particularly, it forced employers to reclassify erstwhile independent contractors as employees, which meant they would have to provide overtime, provide at least the minimum wage, be responsible for payroll taxes, and incur vicarious liability for them, among other things. If they failed to do so, employers could—and did—incur stiff penalties. It also meant that some workers lost the flexibility they had taken for granted, or worse, lost work entirely.",
      "As this blog has observed previously, AB 5 enshrined into law a restrictive standard for determining whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor under California’s wage and hour law.  It did so by modifying what is known as the ABC test, which some states use for evaluating potential employer-employee relationships.",

Indeed, after tallying 3,051 ballots from 5,876 eligible voters, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) had 738 in favor versus 1,798 against it. Another 505 challenged ballots were never reviewed given the wide margin of defeat.",
      "A key part of the union’s strategy included lobbing a litany of dubious charges against Amazon with the NLRB, hoping perhaps one would stick and force a new election to be held.  One of the union’s chief complaints included the fact that the U.S. Postal Service apparently placed a mailbox in front of the Amazon facility. That fact allegedly sent a signal to employees that Amazon was involved with running the election, which is more or less laughable.",

The Board itself declined to assert jurisdiction, though, saying that doing so “in this case would not serve to promote stability in labor relations.” However, the Board limited the extent of its determination and further said that “whether we might assert jurisdiction in another case involving grant-in-aid scholarship foot-ball players (or other types of scholarship athletes) is a question we need not and do not address at this time.”",

The upshot of California’s new version of that test was that it became much harder for someone to be classified as an independent contractor, leaving employers either to assume all of the attendant liability associated with an employer-employee relationship or to stop using the services of independent contractors who did not meet AB 5’s stringent test.",
      "The saga of AB 5—highlighted by this legislation that should not even be necessary—illustrates the effect of policy-making by the uninformed.  It began with the California Supreme Court, which in 2018 unilaterally changed its standard for interpreting whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor.  The Court’s decision in a case known as Dynamex modified what is known as the “ABC” test for evaluating an employment relationship.",
      "The California legislature on August 31 passed a piece of emergency legislation to address a crisis of its own making. The measure, AB 2257, would, among other things, exempt certain categories of independent contractors who have seen their lives upended and livelihoods destroyed because of the state’s ill-conceived law known as AB 5.  Passed in 2019, AB 5 has created a maelstrom in the Golden State as individuals and businesses alike grapple with it.",
      "The result was as a debacle as predictable as it was far-reaching. The broad scope of AB 5’s language created a potential liability for countless businesses that could not afford to take on new employees, so they simply severed ties or otherwise found ways to work around the law.  The response from the newly unemployed was equally negative.  Individuals who previously had offered services as independent contractors in myriad industries demanded that they be exempted from AB 5, so lawmakers scrambled to do so almost as soon as AB 5 took effect. AB 2257 is just the latest iteration of changes, and more will likely come, underscoring again AB 5’s faults.",

      "A central feature of the NLRB’s approach during the Obama administration was its lopsided, union-friendly interpretation of the law in order to facilitate organizing efforts.  The backgrounds of the two most recent appointees would seem to suggest a return to that approach given that each of them come from labor unions themselves.  Whether or not that presents a conflict of interest may be worth a separate discussion, but in any event the new Democratic majority can safely be assumed to resume where their erstwhile colleagues left off.",
      "She also appears interested in teeing up a case to overturn the Board’s 2019 SuperShuttle decision that restored a rational test for determining whether an individual is an independent contractor rather than an employee, and one might expect the Board to declare that alleged misclassification is an unfair labor practice in its own right.",

      "As this blog has noted previously, the Republican majority that existed for most of the Trump administration worked assiduously to mitigate the deleterious effects of the NLRB’s activities during the Obama era—and there were a lot.  In fact, the Board unleashed so many harmful decisions that they filled a 174-page report highlighting many of them, and one prominent law firm estimated in 2016 that the Board had overturned over 4,500 cumulative years of precedent in its zealous effort to rewrite labor law.",
      "Other changes will likely include an attempt to return to the expansive joint employer standard under the Board’s 2015 Browning-Ferris decision, which would require a regulatory rulemaking, an effort to force employers to allow union organizers greater access to their workplaces and email systems, and a renewed emphasis on what is—or isn’t—allowed when it comes to employers’ workplace policies.",
      "For one thing, employers can expect a renewed emphasis on employees’ rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which protects so-called concerted activity among employees.

The report also identifies various sources of funding for each group.",
      "The Workforce Freedom Initiative (WFI) today released a new report titled The Emerging Role of Worker Centers in Union Organizing: An Update and Supplement.  The report provides an updated analysis of so-called “worker centers” following a similar study released in 2013 that first examined the same topic.  As in the original report, the analysis shows that worker centers are an increasingly important and well-funded element of organized labor’s strategy to advance its agenda, with tens of millions of dollars funneled to them by both unions and foundations.",
      "Lastly, the report focuses on the Service Employees International Union’s (SEIU) efforts to prop up various worker center entities in its ongoing crusade for an inflated $15 minimum wage.  The study concludes that the SEIU spent more than $55 million from 2013-16 for the operating expenses of several “organizing committees” in various locations across the country.  (As this blog has noted before, the SEIU has spent $72 million overall since starting the Fight for $15 five years ago, but it has yielded few, if any, new members for the union.)",
      "As WFI’s 2013 report noted, worker centers are not a new phenomenon, but they have taken on an increasingly central role in advancing the agenda of organized labor.  The current report demonstrates that they continue to receive substantial funding both from labor unions as well as private foundations.  To the extent that worker centers are engaging in activities more typically associated with unions, though, there could be legal implications worth considering, given the requirements imposed on labor groups imposed by the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.  Either way, worker centers are a powerful force for organized labor worth watching closely.",
      "To be fair, the Fight for $15 has succeeded in enacting inflated minimum wage ordinances in numerous localities and a handful of states.  As an aside, however, it is worth noting that organized labor often employs a cynical tactic in doing so by seeking an exemption from the higher minimum wage for employers with a unionized workforce. In other words, if an employer accepts unionization, they could potentially negotiate a lower wage—it’s a win-win deal, except for the workers of course.",
      "Either way, after several years and several million dollars, it appears that the SEIU’s leadership has finally decided to substantially curtail the union’s funding for the Fight for $15, which is a positive development for the union members whose dues have sustained the whole thing.",
      "The SEIU’s latest LM-2 shows that the union had total receipts around $314 million in 2017, which is about $10 million higher than the previous year, but it still represents a relatively low amount compared to five years prior, when the SEIU’s receipts were $411 million.  The SEIU’s total disbursements amounted to $273 million, approximately $41.5 million less than the prior year and a whopping $180 million decrease compared to 2012.",
      "As this blog has observed before, the SEIU has poured millions of dollars—at least $70 million, which is a conservative estimate—in the last several years for the Fight for $15 with little to show for its “investment.”  The SEIU’s real objective all along has been to garner more members by organizing the fast food industry, but despite its efforts, membership has not changed much.  The union reported a total of 1,919,358 members, which is in fact higher than in 2012 when it started the Fight for $15, but still lower than one year before that, when membership stood at 1,921,768.",
      "The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) recently submitted to the Department of Labor’s Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) its annual financial report for 2017.  The report, known as the LM-2, is required by law and provides detailed information about the union’s receipts and expenses, as well as payments to individual officers and employees.",
      "Perhaps the most revealing detail in the SEIU’s report is that the union slashed funding for its Fight for $15 campaign for an inflated minimum wage. In 2016, the SEIU spent nearly $15 million for the various organizing committees responsible for orchestrating the campaign, but in 2017 the SEIU’s funding for them dropped dramatically to $7.8 million.",
      "In response to inquiries about the SEIU’s funding for the Fight for $15, a spokesperson denied that the union was abandoning its campaign, saying that it was merely “shifting gears” by shuffling money to different areas that purportedly would not be reflected in the LM-2 report.  Of course, since all of the union’s expenditures are required by law to be included on the report, it is unclear as to how the SEIU would omit money spent elsewhere.",

      "Over the past several Congresses, various iterations of the legislation known as the DISCLOSE Act have been introduced. The profound constitutional problems of that legislation are well documented and include: (1) that it sought to chill associational and speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment by threatening donor disclosure for groups engaged in advocacy; (2) that it provided for unequal treatment of speakers, severely burdening the business community while leaving unions largely unaffected; and (3) that it sought to deter speech through the imposition of unnecessarily burdensome disclaimers and reporting requirements. Remarkably, H.R. 1 takes the worst ideas and impulses of the DISCLOSE Act and expands upon them in ways that have incredibly harmful – and unconstitutional – consequences.",
      "Campaign finance law is inherently complex, and even finely-tuned changes can have unintended, chilling effects on protected First Amendment activity. But the campaign finance provisions of H.R. 1 are not finely-tuned. Perhaps the most striking example is H.R. 1’s sweeping regulation of so-called “campaign-related disbursements,” which captures a brand-new category of communications that “promote,” “attack,” “support,” or “oppose” a candidate or elected official (“PASO communications”). Unlike existing campaign finance law, which regulates speech that either expressly advocates a candidate’s election or defeat or that mentions a candidate in relatively close temporal proximity to an election, the vague and overly broad new definition of PASO communications applies year-round and threatens to consume any legislative advocacy that dares mention an elected official. The penalties imposed by H.R. 1 for engaging in PASO communications are severe – a group that spends more than an aggregate of $10,000 on such communications over a two-year election cycle must, among other things, file reports publicly disclosing all of its donors who have given it more than $10,000 during the election cycle. As in previous versions of the DISCLOSE Act, the $10,000 donor threshold appears designed to target business organizations while largely sparing labor organizations from disclosure of their funding sources, which are typically union dues that are far less than $10,000.",

These informational meetings take place during work hours, and employees are compensated at their regular rate of pay while attending.",
      "Organized labor has long detested such meetings because they are opportunities for employers to provide information about unionization that labor organizers might not be eager to disclose as they attempt to garner support. For example, unions like the RWDSU certainly would not want prospective members to learn that their pension fund is in “critical” status and may not be able to pay promised benefits.",

Barely a month later, the RWDSU is at it again, and this time, the union has filed unfair labor practice (ULP) charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) before the re-run election it asked for has even finished. It would seem the RWDSU is setting the stage to ask for yet another bite at the apple in case it loses this time as well. However, this set of complaints could have wider national implications.",
      "On February 22, the RWDSU filed three ULP charges alleging unlawful coercive rules, coercive actions, and changes to the terms and conditions of employment.  According to news reports, the specific complaints include allegations that “the company removed pro-union literature from break rooms and limited workers’ warehouse access to 30 minutes at the end of their shift to make it harder for organizers to talk to workers on-site.”",
      "What is significant about the RWDSU’s complaint is that the union asked the NLRB to declare that employees may opt out of informational audience meetings held by company management.",
      "According to Bloomberg Government, a different union in New York filed a similar complaint in which it reportedly called for an “immediate end” to informational audience meetings altogether, which would be an even more radical policy shift.",
      "Banning or restricting informational meetings would overturn decades of well-settled labor law, not to mention bump up against employer free speech rights. Yet that may not deter the current Board majority, which is seeking to overturn numerous precedents with blind determination. For employers, how the NLRB handles this issue could have significant implications.",

      "With regard to the order requiring union access to Sysco’s facilities, the court noted that the union had collected authorization cards from almost 100 out of 162 employees and said that “neither the General Counsel nor the Union has made any showing that Sysco prevented the [union] from reaching Sysco's employees.” Thus, it concluded that  “[o]rdering access to a company's facilities and employees ‘cannot be justified as a remedial measure’ unless it is ‘necessary to offset the direct consequences or effects of an employer's unlawful conduct,’” which was not the case here.",
      "With a new Democratic majority in place, observers of labor policy generally expect the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to adopt an aggressive stance when it comes to enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). For employers that the Board deems to have violated that law, one element of that stance will likely include remedial orders that include dubious requirements, such as mandating access to the employer’s property or requiring the employer to read aloud a Board notice.",
      "An administrative law judge agreed with the union and recommended an order requiring the company to recognize and bargain with the union based on its allegedly unlawful conduct.The NLRB reversed that aspect of the judge’s recommendation but upheld others, including a notice-reading order and union access provisions, which prompted Sysco’s appeal to the Sixth Circuit.",
      "The decision involved a case dating back to 2014, when several employees of the food supplier Sysco began an effort to unionize their workplace. After the organizing effort garnered enough support, an election was held, but the employees voted 82-71 against union representation. As might be expected, the union involved objected to the results and alleged that the employer had engaged in a variety of unfair labor practices.",
      "Suffice it to say that the Sixth Circuit declined to enforce the notice-reading order as well. Hopefully other courts will follow suit if the NLRB goes too far again, which it seems determined to do.",
      "To that end, the NLRB’s General Counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, on September 8 released a guidance memo in which she directed the agency’s regional offices to “request from the Board the full panoply of remedies available” for alleged violations, including those two among others.",

      "Economic experts agree that the initial spending and transfer payments will add to near-term inflationary pressures, further harming American families and businesses who are already suffering from higher prices on everything from food to energy. The proposed tax increases, including a new corporate minimum tax on book income, a new tax on stock buybacks, and tax increases on U.S. business income earned abroad, will harm the recovery and hamstring America as we work to compete globally, especially with China. The pharmaceutical price controls could result in fewer drugs being introduced to the U.S. market in the coming decades.  America may miss out on the next vaccine or treatment for the next pandemic because of these short-sighted policies.  Anti-energy provisions in the bill would increase the cost of energy for all Americans and could lead to energy supply shortages and power outages while prices are already the highest in a decade, squander domestic energy security, and threaten the supply chain for clean energy technologies. The bill would also overturn nearly 90 years of labor law to tilt the playing field in favor of unions by threatening employers of all sizes with bankruptcy-inducing civil penalties that do not exist in current law. Finally, because of various budget gimmicks, including sunsetting new programs, in some cases after only one year, the true cost of the proposed bill is significantly higher than the nearly $2 trillion that is advertised.",
      "Nevertheless, Judge Frank Roesch concluded in his decision that Proposition 22 violates the state constitution because it would prevent the legislature from granting workers’ compensation to the app-based drivers. Because the state constitution grants “plenary power” to the legislature to establish a workers’ compensation program, he reasoned, Proposition 22 impermissibly would remove app-based drivers from California’s program, which covers them because of AB 5.",
      "Meanwhile, activist politicians filed a lawsuit against the main targets of AB 5, Uber and Lyft, both of which nearly ceased operations in California before a state appeals court provided them a temporary reprieve in August 2020.  Having been unable to persuade the legislature to reconsider AB 5, the companies and the broader business community decided to present the issue to the public in the election using California’s ballot initiative mechanism. As noted previously, when given the opportunity to weigh in, voters approved Proposition 22 by a substantial margin.",
      "As this blog reported at the time, the Supreme Court of California n 2018 issued a decision inDynamex Operations West, Inc., in which it tossed out its own test for determining independent contractor status and replaced it with a version of the so-called ABC test. In doing so, the court wrote the new test in such a way as to make it difficult to classify an individual as an independent contractor unless that person has essentially no connection to the business in question.",
      "In a decision that strains credulity, an Alameda County, Calif., Superior Court judge on August 20 issued a ruling that declared unconstitutional and unenforceable that state’s Proposition 22, a ballot initiative that voters passed into law decisively in the November 2020 election.  The law defines drivers for app-based transportation platforms such as Uber and Lyft and delivery platforms like DoorDash and Instacart as independent contractors rather than as employees. It passed by a vote of 59% to 41%, but the judge apparently didn’t like the result.",
      "Judge Roesch further concluded that Proposition 22 violated the state constitution’s single subject requirement for initiatives because it purportedly included a prohibition on legislation authorizing collective bargaining for app-based drivers. While the measure does include a prohibition on legislation that could be read in such a way, the major flaw in the judge’s reasoning is that the state can’t authorize collective bargaining because that issue is preempted by federal law. Thus, the judge’s objection in this regard seems to be gratuitous at best.",
      "Following that decision, the California legislature got in on the act by passing the Dynamex standard into law the next year with a statute known as AB 5. The ramifications of AB 5 were felt almost immediately after it took effect, and it left businesses either to assume all of the attendant liability associated with an employer-employee relationship or to stop using the services of independent contractors who did not meet the ABC test. The law was so disruptive that it forced the legislature to pass a series of exemptions for various industries reliant on independent contractors, many of whom saw their lives upended and livelihoods destroyed.",

      "So today I want to discuss something more enduring than a set of numbers from a moment in time—and that is the role of the American Dream—or, more accurately, the countless American dreams that together have propelled our nation forward for more than 240 years.You might say that the original American dreamers were the founders of our government who conceived a more perfect union, who led the grand experiment of a new republic anchored in religious, personal, and economic freedom.American dreamers took that freedom and ran with it.They applied their ideas, talent, and toil to great American feats—the transcontinental railroad, the assembly line, the interstate highway system, the personal computer, the worldwide web, the Internet of Things. These and other innovations have allowed generations of Americans to pursue their unique dreams.[Free Enterprise: How a Gut Feeling Led this Dream Big Winner to Open Her Own Business]The Chamber’s agenda for 2019 and beyond is built around this simple idea—to harness our new-found economic strength, do everything we can to keep it going, and put it to work on behalf of Americans who hope for a shot at their own unique American dream.",
      "The PRO Act would further undermine the private ballot provisions in the NLRA by instead steering union certification elections towards a “card check” process. Under card check, workers would have to publicly sign cards indicating their support or opposition to a union. This has the obvious potential to expose workers to harassment and intimidation. The bill would violate worker privacy by forcing employers to turn over to unions a great deal of information about their workers, including names, home addresses, personal home and cell phone numbers, e-mail addresses, shift schedules, and work locations. Under this legislation, workers could not opt-out from this disclosure. This legislation would also effectively repeal state right-to-work laws in the 27 states that currently have them. Doing so would force workers to pay union dues in order to keep their jobs in workplaces that are unionized.",
      "The PRO Act would impede the economic recovery through its many harmful labor and employment policies.  The Chamber strongly urges you to vote against this deeply flawed bill.",
      "This iteration of the PRO Act includes even more harmful provisions than earlier versions from past Congresses. The PRO Act would radically rewrite American labor policy and eliminate any sense of balance that has existed since Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935. The bill would deliberately eliminate basic rights for employers, such as the fundamental right to have standing in representation cases before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). New to this version of the bill are provisions that allow unions to demand mail-in ballots in lieu of the private-ballot process administered by the NLRB and that codify the so-called “election bar” doctrine prohibiting a decertification election prior to the end of an existing contract.",
      "Finally, the bill would codify an unrealistic standard for joint-employer liability adopted by the NLRB in 2015. Doing so would impose liability based on “indirect” or “potential” control rather than on the clear standard that governed for decades. It would make employers liable for workers they don’t actually employ and workplaces they don’t actually control.",
      "The PRO Act would apply nationwide the problematic definition of independent contractors enacted by California in a statute known as AB-5. That statute has made the legitimate use of independent contractors extremely difficult in the state.

      "Rising industrial concentration is often a sign of increasing market competition and associated with positive outcomes such as output growth, job creation, and higher employee compensation. For example, the taxi service industry demonstrates the strong relationship between rising industrial concentration and increasing market competition. Industrial concentration exploded in the taxi service industry from 2002 to 2017, increasing by 59.6 percent, while output increased by over 650 percent. The substantial increase in concentration occurred between 2012 and 2017, corresponding to the emergence of a new disruptive technology: ride-hailing platforms. Uber’s “UberX” service debuted in July 2012, and Lyft entered the market in August 2012. Economic research has shown that the emergence of ride-hailing services increased competition. Thus, the substantial increase in industrial concentration associated with the taxi service industry was the direct result of new entry into the market.",

      "The change in the lookback period for determining highest contribution base units (to the highest CBU in the last 20 years versus the highest 3-year average during the past 10 years) could significantly increase the liability for many employers that are in declining industries or that experienced a spike in CBUs in a particular year. It would also discourage employers from adding contribution hours in any given year, even to address a temporary business need for increased union personnel.",
      "If there is indeed a change in the rules for determining the discount rate despite these concerns, a longer transition period is needed because any change in the interest rate assumptions can have a dramatic impact on employer contributions. For example, based on the estimates in the GAO report, a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate could increase the value of plan liabilities by almost 4%. This increase in plan liabilities can only be addressed through increased contributions or benefit reductions, which will take time to implement. A five-year period is not long enough to transition to a new formula because these plans are subject to the collective bargaining cycle, which can vary from 3 to 5 years. As a result, plans would not immediately be able to adjust contribution rates, and the only way plans would be able to account for the increase in liabilities before the next collective bargaining agreement (CBA) would be to reduce benefits.",
      "Stabilizing the multiemployer pension plan system will involve significant costs.  These costs must be spread among all stakeholders in a fair and equitable manner because all stakeholders have acted in a responsible manner.  The retirees provided years of service in the workforce in exchange for a promised pension.  The contributing employers made the required contributions under their collective bargaining agreements and the governing rehabilitation plans. While no single group bears responsibility for the crisis, all stakeholders (including taxpayers) stand to suffer if the system is not stabilized. The Federal government also bears significant financial risk if the multiemployer system and PBGC are not stabilized because workers and retirees without pensions will rely on the Federal government for financial assistance. As such, all stakeholders must contribute toward a solution.",

However, as this blog previously observed, overseeing the election wasn’t exactly the NLRB’s only role.",

      "In addition to a major ruling returning to a commonsense joint employer standard, yesterday the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) struck another blow for rationality by putting an end to the agency’s outlandish philosophy governing employee handbook cases during the prior eight years. As highlighted in a 2015 Workforce Freedom Initiative report Theater of the Absurd: The NLRB Takes on the Employer Handbook, the prior NLRB majority undertook a campaign to outlaw previously uncontroversial rules found in employee handbooks and employers’ social media policies. The campaign stemmed from the previous majority’s wildly expansive reading of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, which says that employees have the right to engage in “concerted activity” for “mutual aid or protection.”",
      "Yesterday’s ruling overturned the NLRB’s 2004 Lutheran Heritage Village – Livonia standard for judging employee handbook cases.

Under the AI, all of these factors were to be considered together, with no specific factor or factors being considered more important than the others. Because of this, an employer would never be able to tell whether they had properly classified a worker as an employee or an independent contractor until the WHD made the determination. The AI was rescinded by the Trump DOL and replaced with a balanced regulation that ordered the various factors so that employers would be able to properly classify a worker as an employee or independent contractor. That regulation, too, has been rescinded by the current DOL, restoring the previous state of confusion and uncertainty to classification of employees.",

Those proposals related to whether an employee would be exempt from overtime, finding joint employment relationships, and whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. His actions regarding these issues are detailed below.",
      "While a student at Brigham Young University, founder and CEO Ryan Smith discovered that millions of U.S. households lacked at-home recycling options. Recyclops brought at-home recycling to underserved communities by leveraging the gig economy and a mobile app.",
      "Once they realize what has happened, those workers might wish to decertify the union, but the PRO Act takes care of that by preventing workers from even having the option of rejecting an unwanted union during the life of the contract.  So, to assert that “if workers don’t want to organize they don’t have to” is far from accurate.",
      "As this blog has noted on numerous occasions, Congress is considering a piece of legislation that would radically re-write American labor law and undermine freelancers and other independent contractors. The bill, known as the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, passed the House of Representatives last year and again on March 9 of this year, and were it to become law, it would fundamentally change various aspects of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which has governed the relationship between employers, employees, and labor unions since Congress enacted it in 1935.",
      "One of those changes is the word-for-word adoption of California’s so-called “ABC” test for determining whether an individual is an independent contractor rather than an employee, which is an issue that has become much more prominent in recent years.  The ABC test is not exactly new, but it was made infamous when California adopted a restrictive version of it in sweeping legislation known as AB 5, a state law passed in 2019.",
      "Similarly, the PRO Act applies the California ABC test for purposes of the NLRA, which, as it currently stands, specifically excludes independent contractors from being able to form a union. Under the PRO Act, independent contractors could be deemed employees for purposes of federal labor law, which would allow unions to organize them.",
      "The reality is that the PRO Act would apply California’s ABC test to the NLRA in all 50 states (and without the numerous exemptions that the California legislature later had to enact to mitigate AB 5’s ill effects).  That alone is a dramatic change and it would be the first time the federal government has adopted this restrictive ABC test.  It also is quite likely that once this ABC test is established under one law, it will be the pretext for it to spread into other areas, and we have already seen the Department of Labor engage in rulemaking on independent contracting.",
      "The ABC test in California continues to disrupt longstanding business relationships involving independent contractors ranging from freelance journalists to actors portraying Santa Claus. In short, AB 5 prevents employers from classifying individuals as independent contractors under state wage and hour law except under limited circumstances.  The results have been disastrous for many.",
      "Other parts of the PRO Act mean that the impact on independent contractors and freelancers will not be limited just to those who “choose to organize.”  For example, the PRO Act eliminates right-to-work laws, so that any freelancer pulled into a union would be forced to pay union fees or likely lose their job.  And even freelancers and independent contractors who voted “no” on a union would still be bound by all the wages and working conditions negotiated in a union contract because of the laws around exclusive representation.  Moreover, because these elections are decided by a majority of those who actually vote (and given the decentralized nature of independent contracting, many workers would be unlikely to even realize there’s an election) independent workers could easily be dragged into a union that only enjoyed minority support.",
      "Ultimately, should the PRO Act pass,  businesses may be reluctant to take on independent contractors who could end up in a union or for whom the business must accept an employer-employee relationship where one does not currently exist.  So, whether it’s extracting dues from unwilling workers, trapping independent contractors into a union they can’t exit, or reducing earning opportunities, “only” changing the definition of independent contractors under the NLRA has a significant impact.  And just as in California, those most likely to be hurt by the PRO Act are the independent contractors and freelancers that the proposal ostensibly means to protect.",
      "Defenders of the PRO Act seem to sense this is a sore spot, and they have tried to downplay the impact of the bill on independent contractors and freelancers.  They argue that because the PRO Act would only alter the NLRA, it would only impact those workers if they choose to join a union.",

      "We have always had a difficult time getting qualified truck drivers in our industry. However, it has become more difficult over the last year. For example, truck driver training schools trained far fewer new drivers last year due to the pandemic. This means that demand for drivers is outpacing supply even more than normal. And even if schools can increase capacity soon, it will take time to train enough drivers to overcome the current deficit.",
      "Additionally, due to the lifestyle of many drivers being on the road for several days, sometimes weeks, before getting home, it has been difficult to get enough drivers during a pandemic.

Additionally, 61% of survey respondents have less than half of their pre-COVID staff working today.",
      "Our industry is reporting challenges finding workers for their manufacturing facilities and contending with labor shortages throughout the supply chain. While the truck driver shortage is not a new problem, labor issues at the front end of the supply chain (raw inputs and ingredients) are exacerbating the problems they have finding workers for their own ranks. Demand for CPG products has been relentless throughout the pandemic and has accelerated in the first quarter of 2021. This past March was the second-highest demand we’ve seen since March 2020, when panic buying swept store shelves clean—and the more recent sales numbers show only a 1.4% dip from the year before. The CPG workforce is essential and has been operating throughout the pandemic, leading to increased wages across the industry. Despite paying employees more, the CPG industry added only 4,300 jobs last month. The number is made starker when considered against job openings data that shows 572,000 openings in all manufacturing, up from 537,000 the month before — and the surge in unfilled jobs is primarily in nondurable goods manufacturing, which jumped 20% this month.",

As the airport and aviation sector rebounds from the COVID crisis, the greatest challenge is to rapidly respond to the need to replace the workforce that took early retirement, were laid off, or engaged in alternate employment (consulting or leaving the field).

      "According to data provided by Burning Glass Technologies over the past year, property managers have been most in demand, while the highest growth in job openings has been for maintenance talent. Property managers have proven critical to rental housing operations throughout the pandemic and account for the industry’s highest percentage of job openings. In contrast, leasing positions have fallen in demand and represent the lowest percentage of job openings for onsite property management positions, largely due to the industry’s shift to virtual leasing platforms. As the apartment industry continues to recover, more in-unit maintenance activities will resume, and it is expected that job growth will continue to rise in the maintenance career pathway. However, recruiting qualified maintenance professionals is challenging due to a lack of industry awareness, competition with higher-paying construction-related jobs, and difficulty reaching the desired audience through advertising. To help combat this, employers have partnered with training providers and community-based organizations to develop unique technical training programs to prepare new and untapped pipelines of talent for work.",

      "First, the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the critical nature of broadband access to fully participate in the American economy and society, including online learning, telehealth, and remote work. Moreover, businesses across all sectors benefit from broadband access to support e-commerce applications and operational efficiencies such as the Internet of Things (“IoT”). Broadband access is also important for the use of online productivity tools, and of course, to businesses whose business model relies on consumer access to broadband. Moreover, the economic implications are substantial; IoT is expected to provide a total economic impact of $14.4 trillion by 2025. The digital economy already provides $2 trillion in annual value to the U.S. economy. Consequently, it would not be an understatement to say that the benefits of internet access are broad-based and impact nearly every individual and business. Considering that the appropriations process is intended to address broad societal objectives, such as broadband, it is the only viable solution that recognizes the realities in today’s communications marketplace.",
      "Third, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in addition to the IIJA, Congress has established and strengthened numerous broadband-related programs through legislation including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and the American Rescue Plan. These broadband programs were all financed through general appropriations. This indicates that Congress is able, and readily willing, to finance broadband programs through the appropriations process. Moreover, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress established and funded a number of broadband programs across the federal government. Examples include the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Broadband ReConnect Program and the Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.",
      "Second, in response to Question 12, the Chamber expresses strong concerns about requirements contained in the IIJA that would subject broadband to Buy America requirements (17). Artificial barriers to broadband deployment, including domestic content requirements, will significantly hinder IIJA’s stated objectives of closing the digital divide and providing consumers access to high-speed broadband (18). The present workforce and supply chain challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates this concern, directly impacting the expeditious deployment of broadband infrastructure (19). NTIA should recognize the substantial challenges of applying domestic content requirements to broadband, considering much of the broadband equipment necessary to build broadband networks is not American-made (20). The Chamber recommends that NTIA, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, collaborate with affected stakeholders to address any consequences resulting from imposing domestic content restrictions.",
      "Fourth, in response to Question 18, the Chamber recommends that NTIA consider community health needs for connectivity as an eligible use to facilitate the BEAD goals of digital equity.

Additionally, many home digital health products offered today work most effectively with a sufficient and sustained internet connection (23).

      "- Today, Senior Vice President of the U.S. Chamber Global Innovation Policy Center Patrick Kilbride issued the following statement in response to the release of the Special 301 Report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). The annual report reviews the global state of intellectual property (IP) rights protection and enforcement.“Innovations enabled by IP are delivering us from the current pandemic, and can defend us against the next one – if predictable, reliable, and enforceable intellectual property rights remain available world-wide to secure the underlying investments. USTR’s work to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the global IP infrastructure is critical to a healthy innovation ecosystem. With the Special 301 Report as a blueprint, we can enhance the legal and economic environment to support the vaccine researchers, movie and music producers, scientific journal publishers, software and telecommunications engineers, and countless others whose cutting-edge products have supported us throughout this crisis.“This year, in its filing, the U.S. Chamber identified systemic and market-specific IP issues in global markets like: Brazil, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Vietnam, Turkey, Korea, China, and Mexico (among others). We focused on harmful policy realities like: insufficient patent protection; compulsory licensing; inadequate responses to counterfeiting and piracy; forced screen and broadcast quotas; localization requirements; regulatory approval delays; unfair competition law proceedings and extraterritorial remedies; data transfer restrictions; and general market access barriers.“Today, we reiterate our concern that the mistaken belief that IP rights can be a barrier to access for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has induced some countries, U.N agencies and special interest groups to seek to undermine those rights. Let me be clear: IP rights help – they don’t hinder – access to innovation by enabling long-term investments in technology in the first instance, and by supporting a wide range of public and private partnerships to appropriately share know-how and capabilities through IP licensing.  The U.S. Chamber International IP Index shows that countries with strong IP systems have significantly higher innovation production, invention rates, and knowledge output – as well as greater access to innovation.“We thank USTR and the U.S. government as a whole for their consideration of our filing and, more importantly, we commend them for their efforts to promote and protect American intellectual property at home and around the world.”",

      "“Having survived the pandemic, now small business owners are being hit with surging inflation. It’s limiting their purchasing power and forcing small businesses to raise their own prices and absorb higher costs within already thin margins,” said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “We need policymakers to pursue policies that will reduce inflationary pressures, including addressing the worker shortage crisis, expanding trade, and reducing tariffs.”",
      "Another alarming position Ms. Sohn has taken is her extensive advocacy for government-owned networks. The U.S. private-sector broadband industry is what enabled the United States to endure capacity shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "While we support efforts generally to improve access to FDA-approved and/or FDA authorized COVID-19 at-home (or over-the counter/OTC) tests, we urge you to carefully craft guidance to mitigate likely – and potentially dangerous – ramifications. Unless certain parameters are included in the forthcoming guidance, implementing a free at-home testing policy will likely exacerbate testing shortages, result in significant hoarding, compound price-gouging and fraud, as well as significantly and unnecessarily increase premiums and destabilize insurance markets. Finally, we urge the Departments to permit flexibility and time in complying with a prospective change.",
      "Establish an upper limit on the reimbursement for at-home tests to discourage bad actors from price-gouging consumers and driving up the cost of a limited good. We recommend the Departments cap the reimbursement mandate to no more than $10 per test and ask the Departments to clarify that this does not violate the cash price provisions of The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) or The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) because in-home tests are not diagnostic.",

      "Although the Index and other trusted research demonstrate that robust IP systems help drive innovation and access to innovation, some world leaders mischaracterize IP protections as barriers to innovation and access to innovation. That misconception is the basis of a recent WTO proposal: It aims to waive many of the international IP commitments in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which establishes the minimum standards for international IP protection and, yet, has never been fully or faithfully implemented by most WTO member countries, as reflected in the Index. Such a waiver would intensify market uncertainty, discouraging innovators from pursuing new ideas and taking risks, and thus, harm ongoing and potential efforts to solve COVID-19 and other critical issues.",
      "IP is at the heart of the solutions that emerged to combat COVID-19, from cures like vaccines, therapeutics, and medical technologies to connections like virtual meeting software and 5G. The Index shows that it's no coincidence that these solutions originated almost exclusively in economies with strong IP systems, not to mention that access to these solutions was greatest in economies with strong IP systems. That's because strong IP systems enable allocation of resources, forming partnerships, and transferring technology on commercial terms. For example, robust IP systems facilitated hundreds of voluntary licensing agreements that powered the rapid scale-up of global manufacturing, especially in the life sciences industry. As of January 2022, there were nearly 330 voluntary partnerships and collaborations among manufacturers facilitating the production of billions of doses of vaccines and over 110 voluntary partnerships enabling the production of therapeutics, all supported by the contractual licensing of IP rights. As a result, by June 2022, global vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated to reach 24 billion doses.",

      "Second, while the IIJA provided substantial broadband investments, there more than 80 federal programs spread across 14 federal agencies related to broadband, a trend accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic (9). This presents a significant coordination challenge that confuses recipients of broadband funds and leads duplication and otherwise inefficient use of taxpayer funds. Congress has enacted several laws to help address this issue including the ACCESS BROADBAND Act to provide a central website for applicants seeking broadband funding and the Broadband Interagency Coordination Act to ensure coordination between different entities (10).",
      "Third, the clearest support that funding universal service programs through Congressional appropriations is appropriate is that Congress has funded numerous broadband programs through the appropriations process. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted and strengthened several broadband-related programs. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act included $100 million in additional funds for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) ReConnect Program, $50 million to support digital services in libraires through the Institute of Museum and Library Services, $200 million for the Commission’s COVID-19 Telehealth Program, and $13 billion for states for educational activities including distance learning (19). In December 2020, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which included $1 billion for NTIA’s tribal grant program, $300 million for NTIA’s Broadband Infrastructure Program, $285 million for NTIA’s Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program, $3.2 billion for the Emergency Broadband Benefit, and $249 million in additional funds for the COVID-19 Telehealth program (20). Finally, in March 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan, which included $7 billion for the Emergency Connectivity Fund and $340 billion in general assistance to states, where one of the eligible uses is broadband (21). All of these broadband programs were financed through Congressional appropriations, which indicates the Congress is able, and willing, to prioritize taxpayer dollars to broadband investments.",
      "In addition, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress established broadband programs across the federal government. Several of these include USDA’s Broadband ReConnect Program (established in 2018), as well as other smaller programs in the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Economic Development Administration, the Institute for Library and Museum Services, the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), and other USDA programs (22). Finally, Congressional action to utilize the appropriations process tacitly recognizes that the USF cannot bear the costs of such urgently needed broadband programs.",
      "Working toward transitioning from a pandemic to endemic environment, middle market companies are considering the areas in which they want to invest over the next year. For example, 66% of respondents plan to invest in new skills training for their existing employees. At the same time, companies will need to balance the well-being of their employees and clients with the limitations of their office spaces while adhering to federal or state laws.",
      "Almost half (49%) of the surveyed executives said they are sourcing talent for work that can be done remotely from a broader geographical area than before COVID-19.

      "“The pandemic has been a once-in-a-century event that has significantly altered people’s lives",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2021, more than a third (36%) of middle market companies polled stated they now have employees working remotely who weren’t doing so prior to the onset of the pandemic. Of those, 65% are embracing hybrid work, meaning employees work off-site some of the time and in the office some of the time. Almost half (48%) of the survey respondents have made remote work a permanent option for some employees on a full-time basis, while 42% are considering making that shift",
      "“The employment landscape in America has changed dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we now have a situation where there are too many people without jobs, and there are too many jobs without people to fill them,” said Neil Bradley, Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “In this tight labor market companies that adapt their workforce practices for more flexibility, invest in training and upskilling opportunities, and seek out workers from overlooked talent pools will be better positioned to compete for talent in the post-pandemic economy.”",
      "Like many others in Rehoboth, Shuttleworth’s small business counts on help from temporary-visa workers, part of what’s known as the J-1 visa exchange program, to help meet summer demand. The visas were suspended last year during the pandemic, and while they have been reinstated, embassies overseas are conducting only limited interviews due to lockdowns, leading to a second-straight year in which that important stream of workers has been all but unavailable to Rehoboth employers.",
      "Why the shortage? In addition to the immigration challenges, there are several other contributing factors. A recent poll of unemployed Americans by the U.S. Chamber shows that inflated unemployment benefits and lack of childcare access has deterred significant swaths of workers who lost jobs during the pandemic from trying to re-enter the workforce. Others remain concerned about health and safety. Others say they may not rejoin the workforce at all.",
      "U.S. Chamber analysis of federal labor data reveal the severity of the challenge employers are facing in Delaware and across the country. During the first few months of pandemic, the number of employed workers in Delaware dropped by roughly 73,000. While the economy has started to reopen and recover, the state has only recovered about two-thirds of those jobs, with still 24,000 fewer people employed in May 2021 than were employed before the pandemic began (February 2020).",
      "High inflation has clear causes that are easily identifiable and broadly known.Supply and Demand: Supplies of all types of goods are constrained for several reasons, but demand remains strong because consumers are still flush with cash from pandemic relief supplements. Since February 2020, spending on goods has grown 6-fold compared to spending on services. Spending on goods is up almost 30% while services spending is up only 5%. When demand rises faster than supply can keep up, prices rise.",

      "Monetary policy: The Federal Reserve has put approximately $5 trillion into the financial system since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This enormous sum is slowly trickling from the financial economy into the real economy, which is pushing the price of goods and services up. It will persist for a couple of years, even as the Federal Reserve moves to curb the effects. It was necessary to flood the financial system with liquidity to prevent a financial crisis during the pandemic, and inflation is an unintended consequence the Fed will have to deal with as the pandemic comes to an end.",

      "Several companies reported to us that since the pandemic began, they’ve onboarded thousands of workers. In some cases, many of the employees onboarded by these companies have never set foot inside a company facility, and within this cohort, a significant number of those workers were employed on a temporary basis and are no longer employed by these firms.",
      "Many companies that elected not to utilize the virtual verification process, or discontinue the use of it, chose to conduct in-person document reviews where “authorized representatives” performed the in-person document review. The practice of using authorized representatives/agents to perform the in-person document review had been exercised by employers prior to the pandemic. However, many chamber members conveyed to us that they used this option sparingly prior to the pandemic, as they remained liable for any errors made by their agents during this process. The use of agents provided needed flexibility for companies, but there remained several challenges for companies that left many businesses hungry for a virtual verification process that would have been workable for them. The challenges with this method of document verification included:",
      "In order for DHS to implement the most impactful policy changes to the employment verification process, it must provide businesses with more certainty and guidance as to what documents are acceptable for individuals to submit for the purposes of complying with federal employment verification requirements. Specifically, DHS should give employers more flexibility to accept electronic documents or document copies instead of the original hard copy, which would significantly reduce the burdens on employers and employees alike, as well as prevent workforce disruptions. USCIS should update the M-274 Handbook for Employers to clarify that employers may accept electronic USCIS approval notices for Form I-9 purposes. USCIS processing delays, coupled with U.S. Postal Service delays due to COVID-19, frequently leave employers with no choice but to suspend employment when an employee has an electronic USCIS approval notice but has not yet received the physical notice in the mail. These types of disruptions would be easily avoidable if electronic documents and copies of documents were acceptable for the purposes of validating one’s employment eligibility in the U.S.",
      "Relatedly, there have been several policy changes implemented by DHS and USCIS that have impacted what documents are sufficient to determine an individual’s employment eligibility in the U.S. For example, USCIS expanded the eligibility for an automatic 180-day Employment Authorization Document (EAD) extension to the dependent spouses of H-1B, and L-1, and E nonimmigrant workers. To that end, USCIS clarified that E and L dependent spouses are to be considered work authorized incident to their status, regardless if they physically possess an EAD. There have also been many other temporary policy changes caused by COVID where the agency is providing employers with flexibility regarding certain documentation. DHS should clarify these policy changes publicly and provide employers with easy access to this guidance. The business community and workers would benefit greatly from additional clarity.",
      "With regard to those temporary employees who have since left the employment of the company that performed the I-9 document verification for the employee virtually, there is a lack of guidance as to what companies should do to verify former employees, notwithstanding the statutory record retention requirements and the ability of the company to copy the documents under the INA.2 As for the workers that were onboarded by a company using these virtual procedures and are still employed by said company, it is simply impractical for a business that onboarded thousands of people using virtual means to perform a physical inspection of the identity and employment eligibility documentation for thousands of workers in a 72 hour period. The disruption that this would cause for firms in this type of situation would have been significant. As such, this single concern drove many companies to not make use of the virtual verification option. Moreover, even for those companies that chose to take advantage of this flexibility during the height of the pandemic, a significant number of those companies discontinued using the virtual option to avoid potential liability for violations that could have arisen if they needed to verify their workers’ documentation in short order.",
      "Companies that took advantage of the remote document examination policy established in March 2020 improved the onboarding experience not only for their businesses, but also for their employees. Chamber members found the remote process to be much more efficient and cost-effective than the traditional in-person procedure. Given the difficulties many businesses had to confront during the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies conveyed to us that the ability to perform the document verification process virtually was indispensable in allowing them to continue both onboarding new hires and reverifying the documents for existing employees whose documents had expired. These temporary measures allowed many companies to avoid significant workforce disruptions during the worst periods of the pandemic.",
      "The Chamber supported ICE’s March 20, 2020 announcement that initially provided the flexibility to remotely perform the I-9 document verification. We continue to support the extension of these temporary policies through April 30, 2022.1 There were many companies who used this policy flexibility to effectively onboard much-needed workers during the height of the pandemic. In doing so, these companies avoided critical workforce disruptions. However, there were many employers that, due to the critical shortcomings associated with the temporary policy, either declined to take advantage of the temporary policy flexibility altogether, or only made use of these policies for a brief period.",

Arbitration provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court.

To support his order, President Biden relies on the Procurement Act, a 1949 law passed to provide the federal government with an “economical and efficient system” for purchasing goods and services.

      "The COVID-19 related presidential proclamations that limited the entry of foreign nationals into the U.S. over the past two years have profoundly impacted the global mobility of critical workers to American employers. The consular processing backlogs caused by the pandemic and these pandemic-related entry restrictions will continue to hinder the ability of companies to meet their workforce for some time moving ahead. These policies were instituted in real-time during a national emergency and different administrations went about implementing these National Interest Exception (NIE) procedures in different ways. It remains an open question as to which cabinet level department should have been charged with effectuating the adjudication of these NIE requests.",
      "Last, but certainly not least, the Department makes no mention as to whether its CoSM accounted for the costs associated with the State Department’s adjudications of National Interest Exceptions (“NIEs”) under the several COVID-19 travel restrictions that either were or are still in place today. Businesses fully appreciate the fact that these presidential proclamations created new requirements that increased the number of hours that consular officials needed to expend in adjudicating various types of consular applications. However, the Department provided no explanation in its NPRM as to how these proclamations factored into its formulation for its cost estimates. Presumably, these proclamations will not exist in perpetuity, and employers hope that the State Department made reasonable assumptions as to how such proclamations would impact its cost modeling. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the NPRM to show employers how these presidential proclamations, particularly the increased resources needed to comply with them, influenced how the new CoSM used by the Department helped them arrive at their proposed fee increases. Further transparency would help alleviate any trepidation that employers have regarding the veracity of the Department’s conclusions in establishing its proposed consular fee schedule.",
      "Businesses have other questions regarding the assumptions the State Department made to fashion its new CoSM. One other important topic companies have raised is whether consular facilities remain closed due to the pandemic. While we appreciate that the State Department offered stakeholders some limited access to review its CoSM data,7 more transparency is needed from the State Department for the business community to determine whether the NPRM’s fee increases are based on legitimate assumptions. As of October 2021, 60% of consulates worldwide remained partially or fully closed to nonemergency nonimmigrant visa appointments, with 40% of all consulates worldwide still remaining fully closed. The NPRM makes no mention of how this state of affairs has influenced the ability of consular officials to timely process the applications listed in the proposal, and whether the reopening of consulates would help boost processing efficiencies.",
      "When the first series of COVID-19 entry restrictions were imposed by the Trump Administration, both the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security were provided with the authority to adjudicate NIE requests. However, once these proclamations were implemented in practice, DHS assumed the primary role in adjudicating NIE requests. This lasted through the first few weeks of the Biden Administration, but that changed drastically when the Department of State took over the vast majority of these adjudications as the months passed. Many Chamber members recall these developments vividly, as these changes in policy caused significant disruptions for their businesses. Key executives and critical workers found themselves stuck abroad for inordinate amounts of time as these changes were effectuated and the criteria for obtaining an NIE became much more strict.",
      "Noting the dramatic decrease in work volumes during the pandemic, the Department projects that demand for consular service will be depressed for several years into the future. As such, the Department decided to use a 10-year, rather than a 5-year, average of historical and projected workload volumes to calculate unit costs in this CoSM. The Department decided that doing so would minimize volatility in unit costs. Using this longer time frame to assess workload volumes, the Department estimates that demand for consular services is still lower than in prior CoSMs and will remain so for quite some time. “As a result,” the Department noted, “the calculated unit cost for these services, which is total service cost divided by total service volume, has increased.”",

      "Employers are committed to their defined benefit plans. These are long-term obligations that can be funded over time and providing this short-term relief to plan sponsors will not impact the amount or timing of benefits to retirees.  As such, we urge Congress to include single-employer pension relief in any upcoming year-end or COVID-19 stimulus legislation. Targeted pension relief will allow businesses to provide for their employees as they return to work and in the future, while still protecting vital retirement benefits. In addition, pension smoothing and amortization can be enacted without disruption to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The PBGC’s single employer program is robust with a sizeable surplus and strengthening employers’ ability to remain in that program further supports the PBGC.[6]",
      "We appreciate the delay of minimum contributions until 2021 and the temporary relaxation of benefit restriction status in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which helped plan sponsors navigate 2020. These provisions were a necessary first step, but as the pandemic continues, more action is needed.  Specifically, we support the provisions in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act of 2020 that provide a workable solution for single-employer plan sponsors through stabilizing interest rates and allowing for a longer period to amortize losses.[1]",

In fact, according to a recent MetLife survey of defined benefit plan sponsors, 92 percent of plan sponsors have been broadly impacted by COVID-19, and nearly 50 percent have been forced to reprioritize or redeploy resources/staff internally as a result of the crisis. Over 40 percent have borrowed money, prioritized their cash and liquidity needs, or participated in the Paycheck Protection Program.

Technologies such as artificial intelligence are helping solve many of the problems we are facing today, like accelerating drug discoveries and enabling our understanding of the virus. Broadband and the Internet are keeping the digital lights on for businesses, enabling children to learn in virtual classrooms, and enabling us get medical care through telehealth. At the same time, Congress will need to undertake an urgent effort to modernize government information technology infrastructure to help us solve problems like vaccine distribution in real-time, advance leadership in key emerging technologies, and bridge the digital divide.

      "The COVID-19 Vaccine: A Case Study in the Intersection of Basic Research and Private​ Sector InnovationThe development of a COVID-19 vaccine provides an instructive example of how basic research ultimately feeds in the creation of new and innovative commercial products and how government, academia, and the private sector can collaborate to address critical challenges.The Pfizer and Moderna COVD-19 vaccines both utilize a fairly novel technology called synthetic messenger RNA or mRNA. Researchers at University of Pennsylvania, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, spent over a decade conducting research on synthetic mRNA and published the findings in 2005. This foundational research inspired founders of Moderna to use mRNA for medicines and raised $2 billion on the concept before going public in 2018. Soon after the world became aware of the COVID-19 virus, Moderna researchers used the mRNA technique to create a vaccine and was one of the first drugmakers to develop a vaccine suitable for clinical trials. Operation Warp Speed, through funding appropriated by the CARES Act, provided Moderna with $2.58 billion in two grants to facilitate development of their vaccine.Likewise, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also utilized mRNA to develop a COVID19 vaccine. BioNTech similarly licensed the novel technology developed at the University of Pennsylvania to try to harness the medical potential of mRNA. At the onset of the pandemic, BioNTech partnered with Pfizer, an 171 year old biopharmaceutical company, to develop and test their mRNA vaccine candidate. While Pfizer did not receive R&D funding through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government agreed to pay $1.95 billion to purchase 100 million doses of the vaccine.Federal support for basic research is not the only public policy whose benefits are highlighted by the new vaccines. Immigrant innovators were often the tip of the spear, and the ability of firms to draw on global production networks sourcing inputs from around the globe has proven essential to the development and deployment—with unprecedented speed—of these novel and impressive vaccines. There are important lessons here for elected officials considering the direction of U.S. immigration, trade, and supply chain policies.Last December, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorizations for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines. The story of both vaccines illustrates how basic federal funding – for either R&D or the medicines themselves – paired with private sector expertise can lead to game-changing medical innovations in record time.",

      "Lost amid the headlines about people quitting their jobs and companies being unable to find workers to fill open positions is another, perhaps more worrisome trend for business leaders — the fact that people are switching careers, or moving from one industry into a completely different one, more frequently than ever before. According to a recent U.S. Chamber poll, for instance, 32% of people who lost their job during the pandemic and remain unemployed say they are looking to work in a different industry for their next job. A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll found similar results, with one-third of workers under the age of 40 considering changing careers or switching industries since the pandemic. It’s a dynamic that has the power to send shockwaves through the talent pools of entire industries, prompting businesses to rethink their approach to hiring and retention.",
      "Historically, people looked to switch careers for more money, better benefits, and more advancement opportunities, among other reasons. What’s different about this wave of career switchers, however, is that while the traditional reasons for changing careers are still important considerations, they aren’t the only ones or even the most important ones anymore, says Deb Broberg, Executive Director of RealTime Talent and a U.S. Chamber Talent Pipeline Management fellow.

Those statistics underscore a trend among workers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, to seek out businesses and jobs that align with their values. And while that trend began well before the COVID-19, the pandemic’s devastating financial and social impacts certainly accelerated the desire among a vast cohort of workers to seek out businesses with inclusive cultures and jobs that positively contribute to society, says Broberg.",

      "It’s clear that the move to remote work is not a temporary condition caused by the pandemic but a permanent feature of the new world of work. People aren’t likely to relocate for a job anymore, and with the pressure businesses are under to fill open jobs, they aren’t likely to request that candidates move as a condition of employment either. Together, those two dynamics mean that employers have a much wider canvas for recruiting, and workers have a much bigger palette of companies to which they can apply.",
      "The financial damage wrought by the pandemic can be quantified, but the mental and emotional toll cannot. There is still a very real fear factor for workers on the frontlines — from nurses and other healthcare professionals to restaurant and retail workers — whose jobs involve high-contact interactions with other people. Burnout, anxiety, and other mental health issues are prompting these workers to switch industries. A recent survey of critical care nurses found that 66% have considered leaving their jobs because of the pandemic, citing fear of exposing themselves or their families to COVID-19 as the main reason. “Many industries require people to be on the ground doing work with other people,” says Broberg. “There is certainly still some degree of fear factor today, the question is whether that fear will continue and if so to what degree. We can’t say with confidence that people will forget this quickly.”",

      "As soon as we started to recognize there was a clear disparity in rates of infection and deaths from COVID-19 among African American and Latino populations across the country, we decided to focus on what we could do to provide immediate relief. We focused on providing support for testing and screening, providing PPE, supporting front line workers and things of that nature. There’s a range of challenges facing communities of color. It's access to opportunity, access to health care, access to food, and access to information. We wanted to make sure that we were working to address the longer-term economic impact of the pandemic on these communities, too.",

Respondents were twice as likely to say that lack of workers is holding back the economy as they are to say that COVID is holding it back. Less than 1% said it was easy to fill open jobs.",
      "While the pandemic has certainly impacted the labor market, the lack of workers to fill open jobs isn’t a new problem. In late 2019, there were more open jobs than unemployed individuals. Keeping our economy growing requires that we fill these jobs. To do so, we need to remove barriers that prevent people from entering the workforce, get individuals the skills they need for the open positions, and enact sensible immigration policy.",
      "Businesses only created 266,000 jobs when most analysts expected more than 1 million. Even with 9.7 million unemployed at the beginning of April, workers’ reluctance to return to work and fill open positions was one reason for the lackluster job creation. Another could be that employees know just how easy it is to get a new job – the percent voluntarily leaving their current job is now above pre-pandemic levels.",

The proposed tax increases, including a new corporate minimum tax on book income, a new tax on stock buybacks, and tax increases on U.S. business income earned abroad, will harm the recovery and hamstring America as we work to compete globally, especially with China. The pharmaceutical price controls could result in fewer drugs being introduced to the U.S. market in the coming decades.  America may miss out on the next vaccine or treatment for the next pandemic because of these short-sighted policies.  Anti-energy provisions in the bill would increase the cost of energy for all Americans and could lead to energy supply shortages and power outages while prices are already the highest in a decade, squander domestic energy security, and threaten the supply chain for clean energy technologies. The bill would also overturn nearly 90 years of labor law to tilt the playing field in favor of unions by threatening employers of all sizes with bankruptcy-inducing civil penalties that do not exist in current law. Finally, because of various budget gimmicks, including sunsetting new programs, in some cases after only one year, the true cost of the proposed bill is significantly higher than the nearly $2 trillion that is advertised.",

Because of the pervasiveness of the omicron variant, increased immunity and higher vaccination in the U.S., the pre-departure testing requirement can be eliminated for fully vaccinated individuals without increasing the spread of COVID-19. Removing the pre-departure testing requirement will incentivize vaccination, increase demand for international travel to and from the U.S., and better align passenger aviation entry requirements with those at U.S. land border points of entry and other major travel-trade partners abroad (e.g., the United Kingdom and European Union).",

With declining hospitalization rates, increased immunity, widely available vaccines and cutting-edge treatments on the horizon, America is reaching an inflection point where endemic-focused policies can replace pandemic-driven restrictions. As leading U.S. travel and business organizations, we respectfully urge the Administration to chart a clear course for replacing pandemic-era travel advisories, requirements and restrictions with endemic-focused policies of a “new normal” that enable travel to resume fully, freely and safely.",

      "By March 18, repeal the Federal mask mandate for public transportation or provide a clear roadmap to remove the mask mandate within 90 days. The federal mask mandate for transportation networks is set to expire on March 18. The Administration should use this date as a decision point for either repealing this mandate or announcing a plan and timeline to repeal the federal mask mandate within the subsequent 90 days. Airplanes are already equipped with advanced air filtration systems, and airports have made large investments in air filtration, sanitation and layouts.

Additionally, consumers preferred tailored and relevant advertising.[2] Small companies increasingly used digital tools as a lifeline to reach consumers during the pandemic.[3]",
      "Just before Covid made its first appearance in the U.S., thirty-one states had a solvent, healthy UI trust fund. This meant that each state built up enough of a reserve to pay UI benefits to a projected number of eligible claimants during a recessionary period without having to borrow money from the federal government. Despite preparations, most states’ trust funds were unable to support the extraordinary number of UI claimants ushered in by the Pandemic. At the height of the Pandemic, 23 states borrowed money from the federal government to pay regular UI benefits. Most of these states were able to repay their loans and replenish their trust funds. Nine states, however, still collectively owe more than $40 billion today. Additionally, interest payments on the loans are due September 30 of this year. That bill is currently more than $330 million and will continue to grow.",
      "Congress recognized early on that states would need assistance in financing UI. First, Congress waived the accrual of interest on UI trust fund loans through September 6, 2021. States and employers continue to struggle with labor shortages, increasing the difficulty of generating UI tax revenues. To counter this obstacle, the Chamber calls on Congress to support the reinstatement of the interest waiver which will allow states to address outstanding loans and interest payments without incurring more debt. Second, Congress appropriated $350 billion in State & Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) as part of ARPA for states to respond to the public health emergency. The Chamber urges states to use the SLFRF funds towards outstanding loans or accrued interest, or to replenish the state’s UI trust fund to pre-pandemic levels. States must be aware that per Treasury’s final rule, changes to a state’s maximum benefit entitlement are prohibited if SLFRF funds are used towards outstanding loans or interest payments.",

      "Some governments and media are distracted from practical solutions to achieving global vaccinations with issues unrelated to getting shots into arms. For example, they claim, without evidence, that weakening or suspending intellectual property rights for vaccine producers would somehow hasten the production and delivery of doses. On the contrary, the discovery of COVID-19 vaccines in record time was the product of decades of research and investment, strong private-public partnerships, and licensing technology—all of which require clear and enforceable rules for intellectual property.",
      "Finally, now that attention is turning to preparations for the next pandemic, some argue that greater regional vaccine production should be established, especially in Africa. Continental partnerships announced by Moderna and BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnsons’ partnerships with Aspen, are significant developments in this regard. To be effective, such efforts must be sustainable and capable of addressing the next challenge, not just the last one. Private investment is the key, and putting in place the legal and economic conditions to support such investment will be essential in the long term.",

Last year saw the production of 10 billion does of COVID-19 vaccines, and production in 2022 should exceed 20 billion. These milestones lead Deputy Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Anabel Gonzalez, to note how “never has the world seen such a rapid development of a viable vaccine.”",
      "In all of the above, continuing partnerships between governments and businesses will be necessary to overcome this pandemic and prepare effectively for the next. Focusing on real and practical challenges and solutions is the only responsible path ahead.",
      "The U.S. can provide support for public education to fight vaccine hesitancy, aid in training healthcare workers, increase the cold chain capacity, and bolster medical supplies.

Make no mistake, this move will undermine the global fight against COVID and it will diminish our ability to prepare for and respond to the next pandemic. We urge the administration to reverse course and work with the business community to deliver on the President’s recent promise to make America the ‘arsenal of vaccines."',

However, the U.S. Chamber is hearing from companies across diverse sectors that will be conducting thorough reviews of supply chain reliability in the crisis’ aftermath. Unless closer alignment is achieved between the U.S. and Mexico on these issues, the threat of broad long-term supply chain dislocation in Mexico looms. For U.S. sectors such as defense, the strategic imperative of reliable supply will dictate relocation from Mexico, while any similar adjustment by the automotive industry – which aloneaccountsfor nearly one million Mexican jobs and 4% of GDP – could result in high levels of unemployment long after the crisis has passed.",

Although firms who choose to use the voluntary exemption have been working diligently to be compliant by that date, a substantial portion will need, or greatly benefit from, an extension to manage the new compliance requirements from PTE 2020-02 while they continue to respond to the pandemic. In particular, in the second half of 2021, some firms are simultaneously under pressure to navigate a safe and efficient return to working in their offices while also complying with PTE 2020-02, which requires significant staff training and updates to systems, processes, and procedures. More specifically, while many organizations had planned for a return to office this Fall, the rapidly developing concerns related to the Delta variant of Covid-19, and changing CDC guidance, presents new challenges to established return plans and has the potential to strain organizational resources.",

      "The assumption that IP is a barrier to information-sharing is wrong. In fact, an effective IP system encourages companies to trust one another and work together. That’s because IP protection provides the legal foundation to turn competitive companies into collaborators. To date, companies have forged more than 300 contractual manufacturing partnerships to scale up production and distribution of critical COVID-19 technologies, including vaccines. If governments start tampering with IP laws, this injects uncertainty and actually risks unwinding these existing manufacturing partnerships.",

The IP waiver won’t help us end the COVID-19 pandemic. It will exacerbate our challenges even further, and undermine the extraordinary progress that has been made to bring the COVID-19 pandemic to an end.",
      "The available COVID-19 vaccines are the product of decades of investment in research and development — investment that wouldn’t have been viable without strong IP protections. Strong IP protections provide investors with a chance to make a return on their risky and expensive endeavors, which often fail. In the event that new medical technologies succeed, strong IP laws mean investors’ end product can’t be stolen or misappropriated, at least for a short period of time.",

Manufacturers are on track to produce a global surplus of vaccine supplies in 2022, yet  despite almost 40 million vaccinations now being administered daily, only 6.3% of people in the lowest-income countries have received a jab. There’s no debate that we must bridge this divide. But there is debate as to how we do it, and regrettably much of that debate is centered on intellectual property rights.",

If Congress’ priority is to strengthen the confidence of retirees, small businesses, and essential workers during these uncertain times, then it should pass multiemployer relief without further delay. To do otherwise would make the solution more expensive and more complex. We urge Congress to pass the multiemployer pension relief in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and support the more than 200,000 businesses and 10.9 million workers and retirees that contribute to, and rely on, the multiemployer pension system.",

      "The associations go on to say that “FCC regulation of the security of connected devices would venture far beyond the role given to it by Congress in equipment authorization,” which has been focused on matters such as radiofrequency emissions and spectrum use. The associations add that while the Commission has identified the Secure Networks Act as “a potential source of authority for the limited actions proposed in the NPRM,” the Secure Networks Act does not enable the FCC to “engage in a wide‐ranging inquiry into cybersecurity writ large.” Similarly, the Chamber believes that the FCC’s initial conclusion that regulating the security of IoT devices “is not specifically authorized by the Secure Networks Act itself” is correct.",
      "Growing Climate Solutions Act: The Chamber supports the bipartisan amendment that would add the Senate-passed Growing Climate Solutions Act (GCSA) to S. 2792.  The GCSA would facilitate a new, cost-effective option for addressing climate change to reward farmers and other land managers for taking voluntary actions to reduce emissions. Many entities across a broad spectrum of economic sectors are depending on the establishment of such voluntary offset markets to meet their ambitious climate commitments. Promoting responsible resource management and nature-based climate solutions through financial incentives for voluntary conservation and sustainable land-use practices is a win-win policy that will benefit American agriculture, the associated supply chains, the broader business community, and the environment.",

Thousands of businesses already are taking action in their own operations and along their value chains by investing in technology solutions and enhancing their efficiency.",
      "Understandably, most Americans do not pay attention to energy policy until prices start rising like they began doing last year.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting tough sanctions imposed by the international community highlights the world’s dependence on reliable supplies of energy to support the entire global economy. Oil and natural gas are the primary sources of that energy, and the Department of Energy forecasts they will remain the most-consumed sources of energy in the U.S. through at least 2050. Just as greater use of natural gas enabled the U.S. to lead the world in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since 2005, we know it can do the same for developing economies as it avoids the use of higher emitting fuels.",
      "Throughout our history, America has answered the call when the world needs us.  Such a moment is once again upon us.  With vast energy resources and technological know-how, our nation is uniquely positioned to meet the world’s growing demand for affordable, reliable energy.  At the same time, we must remain focused on the urgent challenge of climate change by developing and deploying the technologies needed to reduce emissions and decarbonize our economy.  Fortunately, we can accomplish both imperatives by leveraging the power of the U.S. business community in partnership with our government.",
      "The invasion of Ukraine also shows why we must remain committed to an ambitious energy transition – reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible at the pace of innovation. This effort also requires deliberate long-term planning and a government/business partnership. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry has pointed out that half of the technologies needed to address the global climate challenge are not yet commercially available or have yet to be invented. Whether in renewables, batteries, hydrogen, advanced nuclear, or carbon capture and removal, there is enormous opportunity to accelerate progress through investments in technology and innovation. With Congress having enacted the Energy Act of 2020 and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law late last year providing well more than $100 billion in new investments, we have a strong foundation to build upon.",
      "This moment in time requires leadership, and it requires thinking about our energy policy not in terms of a binary choice between fossil fuel production and climate change mitigation but rather in the context of energy security and the energy transition. Escalating prices and the current global conflict underscore the urgency to do both, and we think our nation can rise to the challenge and meet our imperative.",

      "PFAS-containing products play a vital role in addressing climate change and other sustainability objectives across numerous industries. For instance, PFAS play a vital role in renewable energy both for solar and wind generation. PFAS coatings are used to increase the efficiency of panels to absorb the sun’s radiation and prevent dust buildup on the panels. And they are also a vital component of state-of-the-art battery technologies needed to support renewable energy, provide heat transfer in semiconductor processing, and form the critical sealants to prevent harmful emissions at industrial facilities.

      "It’s also important to recognize that encouraging responsible U.S. energy production can be a net positive for the environment. Because supply side policies that restrict domestic production do not reduce global energy demand, they do not lead to lower emissions. Instead, they simply shift production to foreign countries that typically have lower environmental standards. This creates the counterintuitive reality of production restrictions leading to higher emissions.",
      "In fact, the National Ocean Industries Association has detailed how U.S. offshore production is an emissions asset, not a liability, citing a 2016 analysis by the Obama Administration determining that ending lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico would increase emissions: “U.S. GHG emissions would be higher if BOEM were to have no lease sales…Emissions from substitutions are higher due to exploration, development, production, and transportation of oil from international sources being more carbon intensive.” Moreover, according to Wood Mackenzie, offshore deepwater production carried out in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico has the lowest GHG emissions of all sources of oil in the world.",
      "Recently released data from the International Energy Agency’s Global Methane Tracker supports this conclusion. As shown in the chart below, IEA estimates that the methane intensity of oil and gas production in Russia is 30 percent higher than in the United States. Emissions in Iran are 85% higher for each unit of energy produced, and Venezuela is off the charts at 652% higher.",
      "There are several different classifications of hydrogen in the world of energy. The most common type currently is gray hydrogen, an emissions-intensive process in which energy is produced industrially from natural gas. Green hydrogen is generated from renewable energy sources that do not produce carbon emissions.",
      "While reducing carbon emissions is an important part of climate action plans for the business world, there is still a large amount of previously produced carbon to contend with. Technologies like direct air capture (DAC) are helping to address this issue by removing carbon directly from the atmosphere via chemical reactions. The chemicals used in direct air capture selectively react with carbon dioxide when air moves over them, allowing the other components of air to pass through.",

Companies like Duke Energy are looking to scale and commercialize ZELFRs such as advanced nuclear, carbon capture, and energy storage solutions to meet this challenge.",
      "Blue hydrogen also greatly reduces the environmental footprint of hydrogen production by capturing and storing emissions produced with natural gas, making the use of fossil fuels a cleaner and more environmentally friendly process.",
      "The number of companies that have chosen to publish annual ESG reports has grown significantly in recent years, with 86% of companies in the S&P 500 voluntarily publishing such reports. ESG disclosures measure a company’s non-financial performance indicators, which include sustainability practices, social criteria, and corporate governance issues. Examples can include quantifying the company’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or sharing details about the board’s diversity and structure.",
      "Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision on materiality in 1976 (TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc.), companies today are already required to disclose material information related to climate change and ESG. H.R. 1187 could veer away from this traditional standard for disclosure that has served as a centerpiece of America’s well-functioning capital markets for decades. In that decision, the Court rejected the idea that a fact is material if it “might” be important to an investor,[1]and explained that in formulating a materiality standard, it sought to avoid a scenario in which investors would be overwhelmed “in an avalanche of trivial information—a result that is hardly conducive to informed decision making.” This legislation is incompatible with Justice Marshall’s opinion on materiality – a standard that is recognized by SEC Chair Gary Gensler.[2]",
      "By contrast, H.R. 1187 would result in an unworkable, one-size-fits-all disclosure regime for public companies on ESG issues including climate change, executive compensation, and pay practices. This misguided approach would impose enormous compliance costs on public companies. It would be especially harmful to small issuers and emerging growth companies (EGCs) without the same compliance resources as large companies. H.R. 1187 would create yet another barrier to going public in the United States, thus removing opportunities for retail investors to build wealth and contribute to the economy.",

      "While it is encouraging that the E.O. states that, “Training employees to create an inclusive workplace is appropriate and beneficial,” we fear that the E.O. will diminish the amount of training that takes place.  The E.O. seeks to identify specific concepts that would be prohibited, but the description of these concepts leaves considerable ambiguity as to what content would not be permitted in diversity and inclusiveness (D&I) training.  Furthermore, there is a great deal of subjectivity around how certain content would be perceived by different individuals.  For example, the definition of “divisive concepts” creates many gray areas and will likely result in multiple different interpretations. Because the ultimate threat of debarment is a possible consequence, we have heard from some companies that they are suspending all D&I training.  This outcome is contrary to the E.O.’s stated purpose, but an understandable reaction given companies’ lack of clear guidance. Thus, the E.O. is already having a broadly chilling effect on legitimate and valuable D&I training companies use to foster inclusive workplaces, help with talent recruitment, and remain competitive in a country with a wide range of different cultures.",

      "For example, would a contractor be required to report a violation under OSHA if a citation had been challenged at the administrative law judge level (the first level of adjudication) but the company intended to appeal it further to the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and then to federal court? If a company settles an OSHA violation noted during an inspection but files a notification for modification of abatement, is that deemed a reportable event under the proposed AGAR clause? If the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (that enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act) declines to proceed with a discrimination charge but the employee has not acted on their Notice of Right to Sue, would that be considered adjudicated? Or what is the status if a charge is settled or mediated before any agency determination? Similarly, what level of adjudication triggers reporting of an unfair labor practice charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board? ULPs are a frequent pressure tactic of unions when seeking to unionize a company or during contract negotiations. Furthermore, every statute cited in the list of reportable labor law violations has its own investigation, enforcement and remedial provision to be enforced by a government agency or a private allegedly aggrieved individual or party. Thus, there is no void left to be filled by superimposing a non-related procurement obligation on top of an already long-standing and legally defined enforcement process for labor and employment laws dating back to the 1930’s. There is no reason to believe Department of Agriculture contracting officers bring any special expertise to this process.",

      "Campaign finance law is inherently complex, and even finely-tuned changes can have unintended, chilling effects on protected First Amendment activity. But the campaign finance provisions of H.R. 1 are not finely-tuned. Perhaps the most striking example is H.R. 1’s sweeping regulation of so-called “campaign-related disbursements,” which captures a brand-new category of communications that “promote,” “attack,” “support,” or “oppose” a candidate or elected official (“PASO communications”). Unlike existing campaign finance law, which regulates speech that either expressly advocates a candidate’s election or defeat or that mentions a candidate in relatively close temporal proximity to an election, the vague and overly broad new definition of PASO communications applies year-round and threatens to consume any legislative advocacy that dares mention an elected official. The penalties imposed by H.R. 1 for engaging in PASO communications are severe – a group that spends more than an aggregate of $10,000 on such communications over a two-year election cycle must, among other things, file reports publicly disclosing all of its donors who have given it more than $10,000 during the election cycle. As in previous versions of the DISCLOSE Act, the $10,000 donor threshold appears designed to target business organizations while largely sparing labor organizations from disclosure of their funding sources, which are typically union dues that are far less than $10,000.",
      "If H.R. 1 becomes law, organizations should not expect the FEC to adopt a narrow view of what constitutes regulated speech under the legislation’s vague and overly broad new definition of PASO communications. That is because H.R. 1 also fundamentally transforms the FEC from a non-partisan agency (comprised of three commissioners from each party) into an overtly partisan enforcement tool controlled by a majority of commissioners from the political party then in power. Although it may frustrate opponents of free speech, the FEC’s current, non-partisan structure was not an accident – it was a careful and conscious choice made by Congress forty-four years ago to respect the contours of the First Amendment, avoid chilling legitimate speech, and prevent the FEC from becoming a political weapon. It was a recognition that when there are close calls, the tie should be resolved in favor of free speech and not censorship or politically motivated enforcement actions. Like other provisions of H.R. 1, this proposed change to the FEC’s structure seemingly has been designed to maximize the chilling effect on groups that wish to express a view about their elected officials and what those officials are doing.",

The Congressional Budget Office has said that if this additional funding is extended for another six months, then five out of six beneficiaries would receive more from unemployment than what they could expect to earn working.

Biometric facial verification, when done properly, is much more accurate than human facial verification. For example, passport officers are, at most, 80% accurate in matching passport photos to people, while facial algorithms are about 99% accurate for most traveler galleries. Given the diverse uses of the technology, a moratorium on federal use would create uncertainty and have a chilling effect on innovation throughout the facial recognition ecosystem. Further, it would undermine the implementation of a long-standing, bipartisan congressional mandate aimed at applying one of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report, namely, a biometrically enabled immigration exit system.",

This trade supports millions of good paying U.S. jobs and is key to U.S. competitiveness in the data-intensive industries of the future. Transatlantic data transfers enable an array of essential activities, including multi-country clinical trials for innovative medicines such as COVID-19 vaccines, cybersecurity threat information sharing, and anti-fraud and anti-money laundering efforts.",
      "What these examples show is that data is necessary to a functioning 21st century society. Privacy legislation should include exceptions for important societally beneficial purposes such as anti-money laundering and fraud protection, research, and commercial credit reporting. Unfortunately, HB 1330 provides NO exceptions to its privacy requirements.",
      "First, I would like to note that data is transforming our economy and has been vital in keeping the “digital lights on” for many companies, particularly small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic whether that be through contact tracing, enabling faster distribution of PPP loans by fintech companies, or helping Americans stay connected through remote work, ecommerce, online learning, and telehealth. Prior to the pandemic, C_TEC released a report which showed that even as the number of data breaches increases, identity theft is holding at around the same levels. This is in part due to data being used to identify fraud and stop it in its tracks.2 We’ve also found that data used by the private sector is helping protect citizens from wildfires, promote financial inclusion, and enhance public safety. Private-sector data enabled law enforcement to locate and stop the San Bernardino mass shooter during his spree.[2]",

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human tracking is second only to drug tracking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars per year in illicit profit.1 All victims of tracking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.",
      "Businesses today are increasingly global, meaning that it is no longer a matter if a business will come into contact with human tra cking but when. It is therefore important to be prepared. In the marketplace, everyone understands the principle of supply and demand. Demand creates a market, and supply will meet demand, with unscrupulous exploiters working to fill it with an eye to the greatest profit margin for themselves. Traffickers use violence, intimidation, and manipulation as trafficking is often hidden in plain sight. Therefore, no demand = no victim = no trafficking. The business community is well positioned to be on the frontline in the fight against trafficking. From a risk management approach, anti-trafficking training should be provided in the workplace. Companies should also adopt an anti-trafficking-in-persons policy with a demand-reduction focus. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, in collaboration with Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), a nonprofit organization that educates, equips, empowers, and mobilizes members of the trucking, bus, and energy industries to combat human trafficking, produced this toolkit to highlight resources and best practices on how to help end this heinous crime.",

      "Copyright assigns market value to everything from song lyrics, movies, and TV shows to video games, books, and paintings. Unfortunately, as more and more creative works are accessible online, more bad actors steal and share copyrighted creative works illegally and maliciously. Fortunately, governments are fighting back. Economies at every level of development - from the US, UK, and Sweden to India, Singapore, and Russia - have utilized injunctive-style relief to disable access to copyright-infringing content online and are already seeing positive results.

      "Double extortion involves data exfiltration from a victim's network. This means the data has been taken by the bad actors and could potentially be released to the public, destroyed, sold, or held. Triple and quadruple ransomware extortion attacks are also on the rise, and those involve either re-victimization or victimization of customers and business partners.",
      "Wrong. Businesses of all sizes are targets of ransomware attacks. Malicious actors have targeted small and large businesses alike, and they can be highly specific in whom they target. All kinds of companies are on the receiving end of phishing campaigns, where emails or text messages go out with malicious links. Identifying dangerous emails is becoming more and more difficult as cybercriminals become more sophisticated. A bad actor might feel like they can secure a larger payday from a bigger target, but every company is at risk.",
      "Ransomware is a type of cyberattack that couples unauthorized access to a company's systems and networks with a demand for payment. Typically, data or systems are locked through encryption of a victim's files, with businesses unable to recover data and get systems running again until they pay a ransom.",
      "While victim organizations are forced to make difficult business decisions to pay a ransom, there are legal and regulatory obligations that organizations must be aware of. The U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued an updated advisory to highlight the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments to specially designated nationals and proactive steps businesses can take to mitigate such risks. Ransomware victims may consider engaging an outside counsel before and during a ransomware event to better understand the legal and regulatory risks.",
      "At present, there is not enough data on the number of attacks and the number of payments made to answer this question with a good deal of fidelity. But we do know that the absolute numbers are large and growing. Victims of ransomware attacks will need to make the difficult business decision as to whether it makes sense to pay the ransom against the operational, financial, and customer-related impacts of being shut down. The alternative to not paying is to rely solely on backup data or backup systems that are not affected by the breach, which is why it's important to prepare in advance for ransomware attacks. On top of this, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has become more common. Cybercriminals like Darkside and REvil employ customer service teams to help victims make ransomware payments, navigate malware removal, and even negotiate the payment amount.",
      "Traditional cyberattacks are used to steal information, conduct espionage, and cause destruction and disruption. Cyberattacks historically have included the theft of passwords, personal information, trade secrets, and other intellectual property; destruction of servers; and overloading systems with traffic. But ransomware is different in that data or systems are held hostage with payment demanded.",
      "Ransomware threat actors have moved to double, triple, and quadruple extortion attacks for a few reasons. First, there's a chance a victim will pay with each level of extortion. Secondly, organizations' cyber resilience has improved. Data backups are much more commonplace than they were 10 years ago. Bad actors may not be able to do much if a victim has a backup, but the victim may pay if threatened with their data being released to the public.",
      "The bad actors that develop and use ransomware continue to learn and evolve over time. One way they have done this is by upping the pressure on a victim organization to pay a ransom in a certain amount of time. Let's call that a single extortion attack. Malicious malware software is injected, data is encrypted, and a demand is made.",
      "Ransomware attacks — a type of cyberattack where an attacker uses malicious software to block access to a victim's systems and data until the victim pays a \"ransom\" in exchange for the release of such data — are on the rise. In 2021, about 37% of organizations globally reported that they were hit by a ransomware attack, according to IDC's 2021 Ransomware Study. That number, according to most experts, will continue growing in 2022.",

      "S. 3143 protects victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment, while avoiding overbreadth that would prevent employees and businesses from using arbitration as a means of resolving disputes in other contexts. Nor does it contain a carve-out that would allow labor unions to use pre-dispute arbitration to resolve their disputes while denying the use of arbitration to others. Arbitration provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court. Empirical studies demonstrate that employees in arbitration do just as well, or in many circumstances, considerably better, than in court. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the flexibility of arbitration served complainants and businesses alike well as arbitration cases proceeded on schedule, while courthouses were forced to close their doors and developed significant backlogs that still present a challenge today.",
      "S. 3143 provides that workplace victims of the violent crime of sexual assault would not be subject to mandatory arbitration provisions in employment contracts. It also sets forth numerous robust rights in arbitration for victims of sexual harassment, including the right to report harassment and to speak out publicly. Importantly, this bill also protects sexual assault and harassment victims’ recoveries in any claims they may bring in arbitration or in court from being unreasonably reduced by attorneys’ fees and costs.

      "Dear Reader:The U.S. Chamber of Commerce established the Task Force to Eradicate Human Trafficking, an advisory group made up of members who work with the federal government and the private sector to develop commonsense solutions and speak with one voice.Human trafficking is a global problem affecting millions of people each year who are illegally lured into forced labor and sexual exploitation through force, fraud, or coercion. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars a year in illicit profit. All victims of trafficking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.Industry has an important role to play. Businesses cannot do this work alone. The business community needs to partner with governments and non-governmental organizations to address the scope of this problemBusinesses face an economic, legal, and reputational risk if they engage in human trafficking. The task force develops toolkits, hosts forums, and engages in advocacy work to shine a spotlight on this problem.According to the International Labor Organization, whereas 19% of victims are trafficked for commercial sex and make up a vast majority of illicit profits, incidences of forced labor are prevalent and widespread globally. To eradicate human trafficking, the task force addresses forced labor in supply chains and commercial sex trafficking.To conduct sex trafficking, traffickers rely on the transportation and hospitality sectors for moving and controlling victims, giving these sectors a critical role as the first line of defense.Regarding forced labor, repeal of the consumptive demand clause in 2016 heightened the need for businesses to be cognizant of labor risks.The financial sector also plays a role in eliminating forced labor. Since 2018, financial institutions such as banks have been required by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to identify and report suspicious activity related to human trafficking.Employers, in conjunction with social service providers, counseling firms, housing agencies, and skills-based training organizations, provide resources for human trafficking victims to heal. This work is done in conjunction with comprehensive social service providers and researchers.As the leading voice of business, the U.S. Chamber plays a critical role in addressing human trafficking. This report outlines activities that the task force has undertaken. These resources include a description of toolkits developed with partners; event summaries; and an overview of the U.S. Chamber’s lobbying and advocacy efforts.We hope that you will join us as we continue to grow this initiative.",

      "Complex mass tort bankruptcies often involve third parties, including debtor companies’ predecessors and successors in interest, suppliers, users, and corporate affiliates.  Limiting the ability of courts and companies to address litigation issues globally would harm legitimate claimants by depriving them of resources and forcing them into litigation.  Compensation systems established through bankruptcy allow claimants to receive timely payments rather than having to pursue lengthy litigation against multiple defendants.  Eliminating litigation, and its extraordinary costs and inefficiencies, also maximizes the funds available to victims.",
      "The premise behind H.R. 4777 is flawed in multiple ways.  For example, there is no compelling evidence that current law, which requires judges to review the facts and circumstances of proposed third party litigation releases, has been abused to the detriment of victims.  On the contrary, the House Judiciary Committee received powerful testimony in previous Congresses that plaintiffs’ attorneys generate questionable claims to influence active bankruptcies and, later, extract undeserved payouts from court-approved trust funds.  H.R. 4777 would, instead, feed into this type of behavior by providing additional leverage to the trial bar in these types of bankruptcies.",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes H.R. 4777, the “Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act,” which would upend the American bankruptcy system, which decades of experience have demonstrated to be one of the fairest means available to resolve complex mass tort litigation while protecting the interests of victims.  H.R. 4777 would needlessly complicate the bankruptcy system, make it more difficult for victims to obtain appropriate compensation in a timely manner, and put in place roadblocks to resolving numerous complex litigation matters.",

      "9:45:We must have a steady supply of talented and hard-working people to do the work of a modern economy so our nation can compete and lead.And we need the right policies, systems, and opportunities in place to prepare those people so that they can compete and succeed.It’s no secret that our nation is currently falling short on both of those imperatives.We have people without jobs—who lack the skills or education to fill open positions.And we have jobs without people—employers tell us positions are sitting vacant because they can’t find the workers they need, when and where they need them.[Read on Above the Fold why by closing both the skills and people gaps opportunity will flourish, the economy will grow, and people will prosper.]We’re working to strengthen the foundation of opportunity by focusing on early learning and K-12 education.We’re promoting smart choices in post-secondary education or training so that students can get a return on their investment and earn credentials of value in the market.And we believe that the future requires lifelong learning. So we must change the way we think about, accredit, and fund post-secondary education.Businesses can help by regularly training and retraining their employees so that their skills remain sharp and relevant.The Chamber’s Foundation is creating business-led solutions, like Talent Pipeline Management, and have launched academies in 26 states to help businesses source and train workers.[The U.S. Chamber Foundation’s Talent Pipeline Management initiative works with businesses of all sizes to create “real pathways to opportunity in today’s economy.”]We must not overlook those who are on the sidelines.Veterans and military spouses should have new opportunities to transition into the civilian workforce.Older Americans should have incentives to work well past 65.The formerly incarcerated should have a second chance at building a productive life—starting with a stable job.And it is crucial that we work together to tackle big challenges, including addiction and the inability of many Americans to move where the jobs are.Getting these people back into our economy will not only expand our talent pool—it will extend opportunity to those who perhaps have given up on their American dreams.[The U.S. Chamber worked to pass bipartisan criminal justice legislation in 2018.]",

Tariffs are taxes paid by American families and American businesses—not foreigners.Instead of undermining our own economy, let’s work with our allies to apply pressure on China and use the tools provided by U.S. trade and international laws that we helped create.Limiting trade is self-defeating; leveraging trade is essential to success in a global economy and creating jobs. [Above the Fold: ‘Our prices have gone up significantly:’ Tariffs Threaten Virginia Businesses]",

Our success has been dependent upon the strength of public-private partnerships with organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Toyota. We are thrilled to present a new vehicle to Ernest Knight, a third-generation veteran, who proudly served in the U.S. Army,” said Adam Rocke, Senior Director of Events and Programs at Hiring Our Heroes.Originally from Portsmouth, Virginia, Knight, 31, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2013 and worked as a food service specialist. While he was deployed to Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom, Knight suffered an injury that ended his military career. He was honorably discharged at the rank of specialist in 2015. With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition. Knight was awarded the vehicle as a result of his winning entry into the annual Hiring Our Heroes’ Committed to America’s Heroes sweepstakes conducted late last year. The sweepstakes was open to all active duty, reserve and guard service members, veterans and military spouses and more than 85,000 entries were received.“Hiring Our Heroes and Toyota are working together to provide an opportunity for military families by offering valuable career development and training, online resources, and education. At DeLuca Toyota, we’ve been serving the North Central Florida community since 1978 and we’ve always taken an active role in supporting the community. We have several staff members that are veterans who have served our country.

The FBI possesses a photo database to empower state and local law enforcement agencies to conduct facial recognition searches to assist in criminal investigations. The U.S. government has been a leader in advancing the technology, driving industry to constantly innovate, and setting the example internationally how to ethically and responsibly govern this technology.",
      "Facial recognition is not a new technology. Its origins stretch back to the 1960s, and the rapid improvement of the technology has unlocked numerous applications across various industries. For instance, government applications include airline passenger facilitation and criminal investigations, and commercial applications include theft prevention in the retail industry, fraud detection, and automated photo tagging. Biometric facial verification, when done properly, is much more accurate than human facial verification. For example, passport officers are, at most, 80% accurate in matching passport photos to people, while facial algorithms are about 99% accurate for most traveler galleries. Given the diverse uses of the technology, a moratorium on federal use would create uncertainty and have a chilling effect on innovation throughout the facial recognition ecosystem. Further, it would undermine the implementation of a long-standing, bipartisan congressional mandate aimed at applying one of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report, namely, a biometrically enabled immigration exit system.",

      "- Today, Senior Vice President of the U.S. Chamber Global Innovation Policy Center Patrick Kilbride issued the following statement in response to the release of the Special 301 Report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). The annual report reviews the global state of intellectual property (IP) rights protection and enforcement.“Innovations enabled by IP are delivering us from the current pandemic, and can defend us against the next one – if predictable, reliable, and enforceable intellectual property rights remain available world-wide to secure the underlying investments. USTR’s work to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the global IP infrastructure is critical to a healthy innovation ecosystem. With the Special 301 Report as a blueprint, we can enhance the legal and economic environment to support the vaccine researchers, movie and music producers, scientific journal publishers, software and telecommunications engineers, and countless others whose cutting-edge products have supported us throughout this crisis.“This year, in its filing, the U.S. Chamber identified systemic and market-specific IP issues in global markets like: Brazil, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Vietnam, Turkey, Korea, China, and Mexico (among others). We focused on harmful policy realities like: insufficient patent protection; compulsory licensing; inadequate responses to counterfeiting and piracy; forced screen and broadcast quotas; localization requirements; regulatory approval delays; unfair competition law proceedings and extraterritorial remedies; data transfer restrictions; and general market access barriers.“Today, we reiterate our concern that the mistaken belief that IP rights can be a barrier to access for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has induced some countries, U.N agencies and special interest groups to seek to undermine those rights. Let me be clear: IP rights help – they don’t hinder – access to innovation by enabling long-term investments in technology in the first instance, and by supporting a wide range of public and private partnerships to appropriately share know-how and capabilities through IP licensing.  The U.S. Chamber International IP Index shows that countries with strong IP systems have significantly higher innovation production, invention rates, and knowledge output – as well as greater access to innovation.“We thank USTR and the U.S. government as a whole for their consideration of our filing and, more importantly, we commend them for their efforts to promote and protect American intellectual property at home and around the world.”",

      "“This program showed us how strong and resilient Black small business owners are, and how much more they can accomplish with critical support like financial grants and mentorship,” said Carolyn Cawley, president of the U.S. Chamber Foundation. “We are proud of our first cohort of grantees and the incredible work they’re doing in their communities. As America’s recovery continues, we look forward to working with the Coalition partners to help more Black-owned small businesses grow and thrive.”The Coalition is a multi-year initiative launched by the U.S. Chamber Foundation and American Express in September 2020 to support the long-term success and resilience of Black-owned small businesses. The program is a first-of-its-kind collaboration with the nation’s four major Black chambers, including the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the National Business League, the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc., and Walker’s Legacy. Since its formation, AIG Foundation, Altice USA, and Dow have supported the program, with two new partners ADP and S&P Global Foundation having joined this year.In addition to the $5,000 grants, the Coalition will provide longer-term resources, such as mentorships, trainings, and additional enhancement funds. In partnership with Ureeka, each grantee will be paired with an industry specific mentor to help them further grow their business. Selected grantees will also have the opportunity to apply for $25,000 enhancement grants in Spring 2022 to help take their business to the next level.Within the program’s first year, the Coalition provided 600 grants to Black-owned businesses in 33 states. Business owners used those grants to catch up on monthly bills, increase payroll, or strengthen online marketing and more. Nearly 60% of last year’s cohort consistently engaged in the Coalition’s coaching offerings; the business owners who participated in those offerings experienced fewer financial losses in the first half of 2021 than those that did not. “The Coalition to Back Black Businesses $5,000 grant has allowed our business to purchase necessary medical equipment, office supplies, staffing, and increase our marketing and advertising reach,” said Melanie LaCour, owner of Alexandria Primary Care Clinic in Louisiana. “My mentors have given me the guidance and confidence needed to succeed and the enhancement grant will be used to hire additional staff, purchase specialty equipment, and improve access to services.”To be eligible for the grant program, businesses must meet certain criteria, including having between three and twenty full-time, part-time, or otherwise contracted employees, and must be located in an economically vulnerable community. Business owners can check their eligibility and express their interest in the program by filling out a short form on the Coalition’s website. The Coalition will invite eligible finalists to complete a full grant application, and more than 400 businesses will receive a $5,000 grant. Business owners will be notified of their status in mid-October. Businesses that are not selected to receive a grant are encouraged to apply again as the program will continue to run through 2024.",

Our success has been dependent upon the strength of public-private partnerships with organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Toyota. We are thrilled to present a new vehicle to Ernest Knight, a third-generation veteran, who proudly served in the U.S. Army,” said Adam Rocke, Senior Director of Events and Programs at Hiring Our Heroes.Originally from Portsmouth, Virginia, Knight, 31, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2013 and worked as a food service specialist.

With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition. Knight was awarded the vehicle as a result of his winning entry into the annual Hiring Our Heroes’ Committed to America’s Heroes sweepstakes conducted late last year. The sweepstakes was open to all active duty, reserve and guard service members, veterans and military spouses and more than 85,000 entries were received.“Hiring Our Heroes and Toyota are working together to provide an opportunity for military families by offering valuable career development and training, online resources, and education. At DeLuca Toyota, we’ve been serving the North Central Florida community since 1978 and we’ve always taken an active role in supporting the community. We have several staff members that are veterans who have served our country.

Knight teaches Zumba at a local sport club. He is currently seeking full-time employment and exploring opportunities to help his fellow veterans pursue their education and career goals. He lives with his fiancé, Julio, in Ocala, Florida. “I am truly happy and grateful to receive a Toyota 4Runner from an organization like Hiring Our Heroes because they really care about veterans,” Knight said. “When you leave the military, it’s a scary thing because you have to adjust and transition to something else.

      "[A]dvice to roll over Plan assets can occur as part of an ongoing relationship or an anticipated ongoing relationship that an individual enjoys with his or her advice provider. For example, in circumstances in which the advice provider has been giving financial advice to the individual about investing in, purchasing, or selling securities or other financial instruments, the advice to roll assets out of a Plan is part of an ongoing advice relationship that satisfies the ‘regular basis’ requirement. Similarly, advice to roll assets out of the Plan into an IRA where the advice provider will be regularly giving financial advice regarding the IRA in the course of a more lengthy financial relationship would be the start of an advice relationship that satisfies the ‘regular basis’ requirement. In these scenarios, there is advice to the Plan—meaning the Plan participant or beneficiary—on a regular basis.",
      "Another trade program that has long enjoyed bipartisan support is the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB), which temporarily eliminates tariffs on select imported materials. The U.S. International Trade Commission leads a rigorous vetting process established by Congress to confirm that products proposed for tariff relief are not made in the United States or are unavailable in sufficient quantities to meet U.S. manufacturers’ needs. The program enhances the competitiveness of American companies and ensures that U.S.-made products can compete in both domestic and foreign markets. Indeed, raising costs for U.S. manufacturers through the application of duties to inputs that are not available from domestic sources only hurts American workers and businesses.",

      "As the official U.S. export credit agency (“ECA”), Ex-Im’s mission is to support domestic jobs by facilitating the export of goods or services when private sector lenders are unable or unwilling to provide financing. Foreign governments have established 113 ECAs of their own around the world. In 2018, China’s two ECAs alone provided 130 times as much medium- and long-term export credit support as the Ex-Im Bank. Due to the extensive competition in this space, it is vital that Ex-Im be reauthorized to ensure that U.S. businesses and workers are not deprived of a basic tool enjoyed by their competitors in every other country.",

      "Overtime Exempt Status under the FLSA: Dr. Weil promulgated a regulation that more than doubled the salary threshold for determining whether an employee is exempt from overtime from $23,660 annually to $47,476 annually. As a result, millions of employees who had enjoyed flexible hours and professional status were converted to non-exempt status and put on the clock. Surveys showed that many previously exempt employees valued the flexible hours and work schedules that exempt status provided. Furthermore, because the rule applied to all employers, some charitable non-profits could not afford to keep employees working the same hours and would have been forced to reduce the services they provide. The regulation was eventually struck down by a federal judge in Texas who ruled that the new threshold was so high it rendered moot the salary test for exempt status. The Trump Administration’s DOL promulgated a new regulation establishing the current salary threshold of $35,568, a significant increase and a level the business community supports. We are concerned that Dr. Weil would again seek to unnecessarily raise this salary threshold.",

      "Other parts of the PRO Act mean that the impact on independent contractors and freelancers will not be limited just to those who “choose to organize.”  For example, the PRO Act eliminates right-to-work laws, so that any freelancer pulled into a union would be forced to pay union fees or likely lose their job.  And even freelancers and independent contractors who voted “no” on a union would still be bound by all the wages and working conditions negotiated in a union contract because of the laws around exclusive representation.  Moreover, because these elections are decided by a majority of those who actually vote (and given the decentralized nature of independent contracting, many workers would be unlikely to even realize there’s an election) independent workers could easily be dragged into a union that only enjoyed minority support.",
