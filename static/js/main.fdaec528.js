To make it easier to unionize fast food, the SEIU advocated for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to expand the definition of joint employer, which the agency did in the 2015 Browning Ferris decision.  That decision could have allowed the SEIU to unionize a company like McDonald\u2019s in one fell swoop rather than having to go franchise by franchise across the country.  This was critical if Fight for $15 was to succeed.","It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if SEIU\u2019s leadership were dissatisfied with the campaign\u2019s performance.  After all, while Fight for $15 has achieved some policy successes, convincing a number of cities and even a few states to institute a $15 an hour minimum wage, it has failed utterly in its main objective of unionizing the fast food industry.  In fact, the SEIU has spent at least $72 million on the campaign according to reports filed with the Department of Labor and has yet to file a single organizing petition.","As readers of this blog are well aware, the Fight for $15 campaign has created quite a few headlines over the past five years.  Which made one of this morning\u2019s headlines very interesting indeed.  According to Bloomberg BNA\u2019s \u201cDaily Labor Report,\u201d (subscription required) SEIU President Mary Kay Henry announced that she has suspended SEIU Executive Vice President Scott Courtney \u201cfrom all of his duties as an officer of the international Union.\u201d","However, the newly-constituted NLRB, which now has a 3-2 Republican majority, may overturn Browning Ferris.  In addition, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce recently approved the Save Local Business Act, which would restore the clear separation between franchisors and franchisees that the National Labor Relations Act had long recognized.","Uber allocated about $50 million in personal protective equipment for drivers and those that deliver food, distributing roughly 30 million masks and 800,000 packages of disinfectant products. Through a partnership with Clorox, 600,000 containers of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes were distributed to drivers in Atlanta, New York City, and Chicago so they could create a clean riding experience.","Uber Eats waived the delivery fee for more than 100,000 restaurants across U.S. and Canada, is encouraging non-contact delivery, and its customers can now donate to their favorite restaurants through the app when they order food.","More information on Lyft\u2019s latest efforts to fight COVID-19 is here, and more on Uber\u2019s commitment to communities is here.About the authorsErica BiegenLindsay CatesManager, Communications and StrategyLindsay is a manager on the communications and strategy team. She previously worked as a writer and editor at U.S. News and World Report.","Read on to learn more about how Lyft and Uber are prioritizing safety, utilizing their extensive driver networks, and launching innovative programs to support their communities.","Uber pledged 10 million free rides and deliveriesto healthcare workers, seniors, and people in need. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Uber Freight has carried over 1 billion pounds of emergency relief equipment and has helped in the distribution of PPE to drivers.","Through a partnership with One Medical, Lyft connects drivers to One Medical\u2019s Essential Workers program, allowing them to access COVID-19 testing and other health services. Lyft is also providing funds to any driver diagnosed with COVID-19 or put under quarantine.","Both Uber and Lyft have adapted the ridesharing experience to reflect the realities of COVID-19 and have aimed to create a healthy and safe experience for all users. Face coverings are required for riders and drivers on both apps, and both companies have provided cleaning supplies to drivers.","Uber\u2019s employee commuter program also offers employers an opportunity to create customizable Uber programs that meet the transportation needs of their employees. The initiative gives companies the ability to cover anything from the cost of a portion of the Uber ride to a ride for an employee working late and includes a COVID-19 safety checklist that all drivers and riders must follow.","In early April, the LyftUp Critical Workforce Program was launched to provide first responders, healthcare, transit, and certain non-profit workers with free bike and scooter rides as they serve the public on the frontlines. In New York City, Lyft partnered with Citi and Mastercard to fund free annual Citi Bike\xae\ufe0f memberships for 27,000 critical workers to help them get to work safely during the pandemic \u2013 789,000 trips have been taken by these riders since April.  Further, monthly bikeshare memberships were offered to critical workers at no charge in the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Chicago, Columbus, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis, and Portland. Free 30-minute scooter rides were also available for critical workers in Austin, Denver, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., San Diego, and Santa Monica.","Amid the coronavirus pandemic, gig economy companies have become an essential part of many Americans\u2019 daily lives \u2013 and an economic lifeline for many others. Although Uber and Lyft have seen ridership drop during COVID-19, that hasn\u2019t stopped the companies from stepping up during the pandemic.","To serve as a vital link in communities, Lyft launched food delivery programs in 10 cities, where drivers pick up meals from distribution centers and deliver them to individuals in need, including seniors and low-income families whose children usually rely on free or reduced fare lunch but are currently out of school. Since the start of COVID-19, Lyft, along with nonprofit and government partners, has delivered over 2 million meals for free.","Lyft has also engineered several different options for getting essential workers where they need to be. In July, Lyft launched LyftPass, a customizable ride-sharing program for employers that provides a way for organizations to pay for the Lyft rides of anyone from essential workers to guests. So far in 2020, Lyft has helped over 200,000 employees obtain employer sponsored rides.","Further, Uber partnered with the National Restaurant Association to create the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund, which will give grants to restaurant industry employees who have been impacted by COVID-19.","In April, Uber launched Work Hub to connect drivers to other positions while ride requests are slower. Drivers can start working for Uber Eats to deliver food, Uber Freight to drive trucks and move emergency equipment, or take an opportunity through Uber Works, which connects people to shift work jobs in food production, warehouses, and customer service. Work Hub also includes opportunities at other companies in need of workers like Domino\u2019s, Shipt, and CareGuide.","Lyft has provided drivers with face masks and cleaning supplies at no cost to them, as well as a safety kit consisting of a reusable cloth face covering, sanitizer, and disinfectant to their most active drivers. Plus, the company supplied tens of thousands of vehicle partitions to frequent drivers to give riders and drivers extra peace of mind.","An old saying goes that if at first one doesn\u2019t succeed, one should try and try again, which is generally good advice. For labor unions that can\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer, though, it sometimes translates into getting the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to tilt the scales until the \u201cright\u201d outcome results, which doesn\u2019t exactly suggest good public policy. Nevertheless, that\u2019s precisely the strategy the union trying to organize an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama appears to be employing.","The problem for the RWDSU, however, is that despite all of its organizing efforts, when Amazon\u2019s employees had their say\u2014after all, it\u2019s supposedly up to them\u2014they voted overwhelmingly against the union last April.\xa0 Indeed, the vote was not even close: the RWDSU lost by a vote of 738 votes for the union versus 1,798 votes against it.\xa0 Notwithstanding 505 challenged ballots, the results were, ahem, decisive.","On November 29, an NLRB Regional Director issued a decision supporting the conclusion of the hearing officer that the nefarious mailbox had tainted the election.\xa0 No date for a rerun has been set (and there\u2019s no word yet if this decision will be appealed to the full NLRB).\xa0 However, it\u2019s quite possible that all the histrionics will be in vain.\xa0 The union has yet to make a case for itself any more compelling than that which was already decisively rejected in April.\xa0 If a similar outcome results again, hopefully the union\u2014and the NLRB\u2014will realize that \u201cno\u201d really does mean \u201cno.\u201d","It is not much of a secret that the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) would really, really like to be the collective bargaining representative of Amazon\u2019s Bessemer employees, and it has devoted considerable resources to that end, including an angry emoji for good measure.","Nonetheless, an NLRB hearing officer issued a report recommending that the results of the April election be overturned, effectively invalidating the nearly 1,800 votes against union representation.\xa0 Adding insult to injury, the primary justification for this was that the United States Postal Service (USPS) had installed a mailbox on the premises of Amazon\u2019s facility at the company\u2019s request, in order to\u2014stop the presses\u2014make it easier for workers to cast a ballot.\xa0 Perhaps it\u2019s na\xefve to think that the facilitation of voting is an important part of an NLRB-supervised election.","Amending the NLRA to include civil penalties would fundamentally overturn 85 years of precedent. For employers, fines could range from $50,000 to $100,000 for each charge of unfair labor practices. That\u2019s over and above any actual injuries claimed by workers or unions.","The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO, is a radical piece of legislation that would rewrite our nation\u2019s labor laws in at least 51 different ways. Passed by the House earlier this year, the bill has 47 co-sponsors in the Senate, all Democrats. Unions and their allies aren\u2019t waiting for more support. Instead, they are determined to change the National Labor Relations Act by inserting the penalty provisions of the PRO Act into the $3.5 trillion budget bill.","Congress passed the NLRA in 1935, forming the core of U.S. labor law. Congress deliberately avoided punitive measures, such as civil penalties, against either labor or management. In Republic Steel v. NLRB, the Supreme Court held in 1940 that Congress intended the act to be a remedial law focused on making employees whole, not a punitive one designed to penalize employers should they (knowingly or unknowingly) violate it.","Prior to submitting the LCA to DOL\u2019s Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system, the employer must notify U.S. workers of the intent to hire a foreign national for these types of positions. If the employer is a party to a collective bargaining agreement, this requirement may be dispensed with by providing notice to the bargaining representative. If there is no bargaining representative, the employer can provide a hardcopy worksite notice by posting the notice at two conspicuous locations at the job site for 10 days. Alternatively, the employer may provide notice electronically, which can be done via email or posting an electronic bulletin, to ensure that all workers at the place of employment in the occupational classification for which an H-1B, an H-1B1, or an E-3 worker is sought are made aware of the company\u2019s intention to hire the foreign national.","Since peaking at roughly 35% of the workforce in the 1950s, union membership has steadily declined, and in 2017 it stood at just 10.7%, with a mere 6.5% membership rate in the private sector. Reversing this trend has been a longstanding priority for organized labor, but despite numerous efforts over the years the slide in membership has continued. An increasingly frustrated union movement has now launched its latest attempt, which involves a dramatic rewrite of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and other statutes. The crux of this endeavor is two pieces of legislation: the Workplace Democracy Act (S. 2810 and H.R. 5728, 115th Congress), introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and the Workers\u2019 Freedom to Negotiate Act (S. 3064 and H.R. 6080, 115th Congress), introduced by Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Rep. Bobby Scott (D-VA)...","The AB 5 bill codified a dubious \u201cABC\u201d test that made classifying an individual as an independent contractor significantly more difficult. This test was first adopted by the state supreme court\u2019s decision in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court of Los Angeles.  Despite the judicial and legislative actions, however, public sentiment does not appear to support these ideological diktats.","Six months later, new polling information suggests that Californians who work as independent contractors maintain their support for that decision.  An independent research firm, Benneson Strategy Group, surveyed delivery people who have driven using the Uber or Uber Eats platform since January 2021 to gauge their sentiment, and the results were quite clear.","Indeed, as this blog recounted on a few occasions, many of the independent contractors that AB 5 purportedly sought to protect had their careers\u2014not to mention their lives\u2014upended because of the law.  That\u2019s because businesses had to choose whether or not they could bear the costs and liabilities of having an employment relationship with their erstwhile independent contractors, which led many to sever ties after concluding that they could not.","The damage caused by AB 5 was so extensive that the California legislature was forced to pass bills exempting industry after industry before the proverbial ink was dry.  After a concerted effort by the business community and countless independent contractors who organized themselves against AB 5, California voters had their say in November 2020, when they passed Proposition 22, which provides that drivers for app-based rideshare and delivery companies may remain independent contractors rather than employees if certain conditions are met.","Awareness of Proposition 22 was almost universal (92%) among respondents, and 63% said it had already impacted them directly. Of those, nine out of ten said the impact had been positive. Asked how they felt now that Proposition 22 had passed, 82% said they were happy it had, and 51% said that they were very happy, with 76% agreeing that the measure benefitted them personally.","As observers of labor policy know, unions and their allies have undertaken a concerted effort in recent years to undermine independent contracting, and that effort has led to misguided policies like California\u2019s notorious legislation known as AB 5, the ramifications of which are still unfolding.","At a broader level, 75% of respondents also said that the policies adopted by Proposition 22 would provide a better future for them, and likewise 75% agreed that drivers in other states would benefit if a law similar to Proposition 22 were adopted there.  A great majority (84%) agreed that Proposition 22 is a better alternative than forcing drivers into a traditional employee relationship, while almost as many also agreed having more of a safety net is also better.  Over 80% also said they enjoy the flexibility and independence that comes with being an independent contractor.","Changes that would overturn nearly 90 years of labor law to tilt the playing field in favor of unions by threatening employers of all sizes with bankruptcy-inducing civil penalties that do not exist in current law.","On March 17 \u2014 just days before the election was to start \u2014 an NLRB Regional Director filed a petition in federal court seeking an injunction under Section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The petition asked the court to force Amazon to rehire an employee who had been fired from his job \u2013 and for strong reasons \u2013 but some observers questioned the timing of the petition, especially given the fact that the erstwhile employee\u2019s dismissal had occurred almost two years before.","After a months-long campaign, a labor union that had been attempting to organize an Amazon facility in Staten Island, New York (known as its JFK8 facility) came out ahead in a representation election, according to news reports today. The nascent Amazon Workers Union garnered 2,654 votes in favor versus 2,131 against representation in the election, which was overseen by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). However, as this blog previously observed, overseeing the election wasn\u2019t exactly the NLRB\u2019s only role.","Now that the votes have been counted, it would seem the NLRB\u2019s action in filing the court petition had the desired effect of casting the company in a bad light right before voting started. Given that the vote margin represents roughly 10% of all votes cast, it is not unreasonable to seriously question whether the timing of the NLRB petition swayed just enough voters to swing the election \u2013 which is decidedly not the role the agency is supposed to play in these matters.","The U.S. Chamber on March 7, 2022, submitted comments to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the case Stericycle, Inc. 371 NLRB No. 48 (2021) in response to the NLRB's invitation for briefs addressing whether the Board should adopt a new legal standard to determine whether employer work rules violate Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.","In its comments, the Chamber argues that the Board should maintain its current employer work rules standards under The Boeing Co., 365 NLRB No. 154 (Dec. 14, 2017), and its progeny. These standards have provided a predictable and administrable framework for employers to maintain reasonable work rules and fulfill their duty to respect employee rights.","This legislative session, the Virginia State Legislature has taken up numerous pieces of legislation dealing with worker classification, in other words, when a worker should be considered an employee or an independent contractor. This, in part, stems from Governor Northam\u2019s employee misclassification and payroll fraud press release. H.B. 1407, expected to be signed into law in the near future, looks to be the first misclassification bill to make it over the finish line.","After AB 5 took effect in January, it did not take long for politicians of a certain stripe to assail Uber and Lyft, arguing the companies were misclassifying drivers who use those platforms to find customers.  A lawsuit soon followed.  On August 10, San Francisco-based Judge Ethan P. Schulman ruled against the rideshare companies, but he stayed his ruling for ten days to allow time for an appeals court to intervene if it so chose, which thankfully it did. In the meantime, the companies\u2019 CEOs will have to certify to the appeals court that in the event their appeal fails to overturn Judge Schulman\u2019s ruling, they can comply with AB 5 within 30 days.  However, the appeals court also noted that a pending ballot initiative may exempt gig companies from AB-5, which if it passes would make the litigation moot.","That legislation codified an equally misguided decision by the California Supreme Court known as Dynamex in which that court first modified what is known as the \u201cABC\u201d test for evaluating an employment relationship. Under part \u201cB\u201d of a typical ABC test, a business can usually satisfy that element if the work being performed is done outside of all physical locations of the business in question, such as in one\u2019s own vehicle.  In contrast, California\u2019s peculiar version of the ABC test is intended to make it harder to classify someone as an independent contractor by removing that qualification and saying services provided by an independent contractor must be \u201coutside the usual course of business\u201d of the hiring entity.","The prospect of companies like Uber and Lyft suspending\u2014or ultimately ending\u2014their operations in California would seem to belie the Golden State\u2019s reputation as a haven for innovative technology companies.  That possibility\u2014made real by the state\u2019s lawsuit\u2014seemed to hit home, as San Diego\u2019s Republican mayor and San Jose\u2019s Democrat mayor issued a statement asking the appellate court to stay the lower court ruling. Apparently, they comprehend that it might not be good to \u201cshut down an industry that\u2019s vital to the income and livelihood of millions.\u201d","Of course, such a reclassification would have other consequences that those same politicians blithely dismiss. The negative impact of AB 5 has been well-established, as individuals in numerous industries looking for flexibility in their work\u2014or any work during a pandemic for that matter\u2014face the loss of their very livelihoods. For their part, consumers who have grown used to the convenience of ridesharing, delivery, and other innovative services made possible by the technological savvy of the people who founded Lyft and Uber and other app-based companies could suddenly be forced to use less attractive options, assuming such options are available.","When it comes to policies that promote economic growth, politicians in California aren\u2019t always particularly astute, a lamentable fact that was almost underscored this week. That\u2019s because the state is threatening the viability in California of two of its biggest success stories, rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. The two businesses are embroiled in a judicial struggle to maintain their business model in California, and the ongoing dispute almost resulted in the firms shutting down operations in the state. An order by a California appeals court spared the millions of people in California, both drivers and customers, who use their services from that fate\u2014at least for now.","Unfortunately, there is more at play in the effort against gig-economy companies.  Behind much of it is organized labor, which has sought any way possible to reverse its six-plus decade membership decline. Since independent contractors cannot unionize, successfully reclassifying drivers for rideshare companies as employees could open the door for organizing efforts to that end. The politicians whom unions lavish with support got the message.","The situation is a direct result of the misguided\u2014to be polite\u2014decisions of certain public officials who seem to know little about running a business.  As this blog has reported in the past, the California legislature in 2019 passed a law known as AB 5, which deliberately redefined the standard for determining whether an individual may be classified as an independent contractor rather than employee.","Ahead of the Union Election at Amazon, NLRB Files Questionable Petition","Our concerns echo those expressed in statements to ISO from the International Labor Organization(ILO) Secretary -General Guy Ryder (Annex 1), the International Labor Office (Annex 2), and the jointstatement from the International Organization of E mployers (IOE) and the International Trade UnionConfederation (ITUC) (Annex 3).

In the ensuing years, the Fight for $15 has waged a campaign ostensibly to pressure McDonald\u2019s into forcing its franchises to pay an inflated minimum wage of $15 per hour. The real prize for the SEIU, though, was the prospect of forcing those franchises to accept unionization, which would potentially provide the union with tens of millions of dollars in additional revenue from dues and initiation fees\u2014hence the SEIU\u2019s investment.","The Fight for $15 filed dozens of complaints on behalf of workers at McDonald\u2019s franchises in 2012, and the NLRB General Counsel at the time, Richard Griffin, gladly prosecuted the case in the hopes of declaring McDonald\u2019s to be a joint employer of the workers in question.  For their part, the NLRB Board members eased the way for such a finding by radically altering the legal standard for joint employment in the deeply flawed 2015 Browning-Ferris decision.","Despite those efforts, the McDonald\u2019s case slowly meandered through the NLRB\u2019s adjudication process past the end of the Obama administration.  Meanwhile, Richard Griffin\u2019s term expired in November 2017, and he was replaced shortly thereafter by Peter Robb, who seemingly does not share Griffin\u2019s zeal for distorting the law.","In a statement, the NLRB said the settlement \u201cwould avoid years of possible additional litigation\u201d and deliver a \u201cfull remedy\u201d for the employees in the cases.  Of course, that outcome is of little use to the SEIU, which has failed to sign up new members in its extensive campaign.  Unfortunately for the union, if the settlement goes through, it may soon realize that its multi-million dollar investment didn\u2019t pay the dividends it had hoped for.","A significant case at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) involving the McDonald\u2019s Corporation has taken a new turn that could lead to a settlement that may be pretty worrisome for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).","The campaign against McDonald\u2019s included the typical activities associated with union organizing drives, such as raucous demonstrations full of street-theater and protests outside of McDonalds\u2019 shareholder conventions. Likewise, it also included using the levers of government to apply pressure, and sympathetic officials in the Obama NLRB were happy assist.","That provision would affirm McDonald\u2019s legal separation from its franchises and lessen the likelihood that the company would be held liable for alleged violations of labor law at franchises, which are typically owned by small businesses. Such a result would undermine the SEIU\u2019s multi-year campaign against McDonald\u2019s for which the union has \u201cinvested\u201d millions of dollars.","The NLRB\u2019s General Counsel and McDonald\u2019s told an administrative law judge on March 19 that they had agreed on the terms of the settlement.

Section 7 of the NLRA guarantees \u201cthe right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations . . . and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d Whereas an employer generally has the right to exclude individuals from its premises\u2014just as any other property owner does\u2014the protections under Section 7 can conflict with that right. The NLRB and federal courts have struggled for decades about how to handle such conflicts.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) last month overturned a 2019 decision by the erstwhile Republican majority at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) dealing with the circumstances under which employers may exclude individuals from their private property.  The decision remands the issue to the NLRB\u2014now run by a Democratic majority\u2014and opens the door for a policy reversal that will hamstring employers.","On appeal to the D.C.

On the other hand, employers have greater flexibility to exclude non-employees even if they are engaging in labor organizing activities. Excluding non-employees who work for a contractor on an employer\u2019s premises presents a third scenario that the NLRB\u2019s 2019 decision addressed.","An administrative law judge sided with the musicians under precedent set by New York New York, a 2011 NLRB decision holding that a property owner may lawfully exclude employees of a contractor who usually work on the premises \u201conly where the owner is able to demonstrate that their activity significantly interferes with his use of the property or where exclusion is justified by another legitimate business reason.\u201d","It is not necessary that the injury or illness result from conditions, activities, or hazards that are uniquely occupational in nature.

Especially in the middle of the current economic crisis, that\u2019s hardly something to celebrate, but what makes things even worse is the Democrat-backedProtecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act. That bill, which the House of Representatives has already passed, would codify the Dynamex ABC test and apply it nationwide. California\u2019s lawsuit and the PRO Act make clearwhat organized labor and its political allies want, even if it means undermining businesses that offer greater economic opportunity, not to mention a safe ride home.","The criteria established under the Dynamex decision and subsequently by AB 5 essentially create a presumption that a worker is an employee in most cases, and employers face a high bar to prove otherwise. This shift occurred by changing what is known as the\u201cABC\u201d testfor evaluating an employment relationship. Under part \u201cB\u201d of the previous ABC test, a business could usually satisfy that element if the work being performed was done outside of all physical locations of the business in question.  In contrast, the new standard removes that qualification, which makes it significantly more difficult for a business to classify someone as an independent contractor.","On May 5, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, as well as the city attorneys of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, filed alawsuitagainst Uber and Lyft alleging that the pair of gig economy companies are violating state law through their use of independent contractors who drive utilizing the companies\u2019 rider-driver pairing technology.  The suit is based on California\u2019s controversialAB 5, statute, which codified a 2018 California Supreme Court case known asDynamex.

Not surprisingly, one of the strongest drivers\u2014pardon the pun\u2014of the effort against gig-economy companies is organized labor, which has looked far and wide for any way to reverse its six-plus decademembership decline. Since independent contractors cannot unionize, successfully reclassifying them as employees would open the door for organizing efforts to that end.","The fifth day of May is better known in many quarters as Cinco de Mayo, a celebration of the day that Mexico defeated the French empire at the battle of San Puebla on May 5, 1862.

Under the PRO Act, independent contractors could be deemed employees for purposes of federal labor law, which would allow unions to organize them.","As this blog has noted on numerous occasions, Congress is considering a piece of legislation that would radically re-write American labor law and undermine freelancers and other independent contractors. The bill, known as the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, passed the House of Representatives last year and again on March 9 of this year, and were it to become law, it would fundamentally change various aspects of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which has governed the relationship between employers, employees, and labor unions since Congress enacted it in 1935.","One of those changes is the word-for-word adoption of California\u2019s so-called \u201cABC\u201d test for determining whether an individual is an independent contractor rather than an employee, which is an issue that has become much more prominent in recent years.  The ABC test is not exactly new, but it was made infamous when California adopted a restrictive version of it in sweeping legislation known as AB 5, a state law passed in 2019.","The ABC test in California continues to disrupt longstanding business relationships involving independent contractors ranging from freelance journalists to actors portraying Santa Claus. In short, AB 5 prevents employers from classifying individuals as independent contractors under state wage and hour law except under limited circumstances.  The results have been disastrous for many.","Once they realize what has happened, those workers might wish to decertify the union, but the PRO Act takes care of that by preventing workers from even having the option of rejecting an unwanted union during the life of the contract.  So, to assert that \u201cif workers don\u2019t want to organize they don\u2019t have to\u201d is far from accurate.","The reality is that the PRO Act would apply California\u2019s ABC test to the NLRA in all 50 states (and without the numerous exemptions that the California legislature later had to enact to mitigate AB 5\u2019s ill effects).  That alone is a dramatic change and it would be the first time the federal government has adopted this restrictive ABC test.  It also is quite likely that once this ABC test is established under one law, it will be the pretext for it to spread into other areas, and we have already seen the Department of Labor engage in rulemaking on independent contracting.","Other parts of the PRO Act mean that the impact on independent contractors and freelancers will not be limited just to those who \u201cchoose to organize.\u201d  For example, the PRO Act eliminates right-to-work laws, so that any freelancer pulled into a union would be forced to pay union fees or likely lose their job.  And even freelancers and independent contractors who voted \u201cno\u201d on a union would still be bound by all the wages and working conditions negotiated in a union contract because of the laws around exclusive representation.  Moreover, because these elections are decided by a majority of those who actually vote (and given the decentralized nature of independent contracting, many workers would be unlikely to even realize there\u2019s an election) independent workers could easily be dragged into a union that only enjoyed minority support.","Defenders of the PRO Act seem to sense this is a sore spot, and they have tried to downplay the impact of the bill on independent contractors and freelancers.  They argue that because the PRO Act would only alter the NLRA, it would only impact those workers if they choose to join a union.","Ultimately, should the PRO Act pass,  businesses may be reluctant to take on independent contractors who could end up in a union or for whom the business must accept an employer-employee relationship where one does not currently exist.  So, whether it\u2019s extracting dues from unwilling workers, trapping independent contractors into a union they can\u2019t exit, or reducing earning opportunities, \u201conly\u201d changing the definition of independent contractors under the NLRA has a significant impact.

More importantly, should the crusade against supposed misclassification continue, it remains to be seen whether such gig-economy companies can even continue doing business in a state known for its high-tech industry. How ironic.","That flawed\u2014and cynical\u2014assessment has led to an all-out assault on companies in the so-called gig economy that offer platforms for customers to procure goods and services from individuals willing to provide them for predetermined fees or rates. For example, as this blog reported last month, the California attorney general and several city attorneys filed a lawsuit against Uber and Lyft alleging that the pair of gig economy companies are violating state law through their use of independent contractors who utilize the companies\u2019 technology.","The complaint against Uber and Lyft alleges that the companies are violating California\u2019s relatively new, controversial law known as AB 5 that redefines the standard for classifying independent contractors. In contrast, the suit against DoorDash further argues that the company is in violation of section 17200 of the state Business and Professions Code, which defines \u201cunfair competition\u201d as \u201cany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act,\u201d due to its failure to abide by AB 5. As such, the company could be slapped with a $2,500 civil penalty for each violation.","In addition to civil penalties, the lawsuit against DoorDash seeks \u201crestitution\u201d in the form of back wages allegedly owed as well as an injunction barring the company from continuing to classify so-called Dashers, who deliver food using the platform, as independent contractors. In an apparent coincidence, the California attorney general reportedly has asked the court hearing the case against Uber and Lyft for a preliminary injunction as well, all of which could cease the companies\u2019 operations in the state if the injunctions are granted.","While the rhetoric surrounding these lawsuits is couched in terms of alleged misclassification as it relates to California labor law, one can be forgiven for concluding that the state\u2019s AB 5 standard has more to do with the wishes of organized labor, which supported the legislation to say the least. The reason for that is simple enough: membership in labor unions, which independent contractors cannot join, has been declining for decades.","The state of California demonstrates its reluctance to foster a good business environment on a regular basis and with seeming alacrity, and one bugaboo du jour among the Golden State\u2019s policymakers is the area of alleged misclassification of independent contractors. The upshot of their position is that employers deliberately fail to categorize such contractors as employees to avoid the extra costs and liability that attach to an employer-employee relationship.","Last week, one of the most aggressive proposals threatening independent contractors went into effect in\u2014you guessed it\u2014 California.

At stake is the flexibility and independence that have made \u201cside gigs\u201d or second jobs an important part of how millions of Americans support themselves and their families.","Unfortunately, the impact extends far beyond the gig economy. These regulations affect everything from trucking and construction, to information technology and insurance, and even newspaper reporting\u2014with potentially huge effects on our national economy. Clearly, there is more at stake here than just a couple of states adopting bad laws.","Today, the Chamber is releasing a new report on how aggressive new state regulations of the gig economy will suppress business opportunities and limit consumer choice and services.","In another prominent example, some states are abandoning long-standing definitions of who should be considered an independent contractor.

But other parts of the PRO Act mean that the impact on independent contractors and freelancers will not be limited just to those who \u201cchoose to join a union.\u201d For example, the PRO Act eliminates right-to-work laws, so that any independent contractor or freelancer pulled into a union would be forced to pay union fees or lose their job.","Should the PRO Act pass, businesses will be reluctant to take on independent contractors who could end up in a union, or for whom the business must accept an employer-employee relationship where one does not currently exist. This will limit earning opportunities for these workers.","In addition, even freelancers and independent contractors who voted \u201cno\u201d on a union would still be bound by all the wages and working conditions negotiated in a union contract. This could deprive them of flexible hours, rates, and performance measures.","Question: Since the PRO Act only amends the NLRA, wouldn\u2019t it only impact those workers who choose to join a union?\xa0ANSWER:","Question:\xa0If independent contractors change their minds or are dissatisfied with a union, couldn\u2019t they just decertify them?\xa0ANSWER:","On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, I am writing to share our views on the recently concluded 27th Congress of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) held in Abidjan, C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire.

However, after boasting of a large-scale protest, the so-called March on McDonald\u2019s did not exactly live up to its organizers\u2019 hype, which could mean that the budget cuts at the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) are starting to have an impact.","The Wall Street Journal\u200b published an article earlier this week highlighting the foundering Fight for $15 and quoted former SEIU president Andy Stern, who said \u201cThe problem for the union is when dues collected from collective bargaining is your only revenue source, a social movement like Fight for $15 transfers money from your members to a broad-based fight\u2026You need a different business model.\u201d","Unfortunately for the SEIU\u2019s dues paying members, after nearly five years with little to show for their \u2018investment,\u2019 the union\u2019s leadership seems intent on pouring good money after bad in the apparent hope that their fortunes might change.","As this blog has noted previously, the Fight for $15 has been the SEIU\u2019s front group in an ongoing campaign against fast food companies like McDonald\u2019s for several years.  While the group emphasizes its desire for an inflated minimum wage of $15 per hour\u2014and, indeed it has succeeded in achieving that goal in some cities and states\u2014its real objective is and always has been to unionize the fast food industry.","Campaign finance law is inherently complex, and even finely-tuned changes can have unintended, chilling effects on protected First Amendment activity. But the campaign finance provisions of H.R. 1 are not finely-tuned. Perhaps the most striking example is H.R. 1\u2019s sweeping regulation of so-called \u201ccampaign-related disbursements,\u201d which captures a brand-new category of communications that \u201cpromote,\u201d \u201cattack,\u201d \u201csupport,\u201d or \u201coppose\u201d a candidate or elected official (\u201cPASO communications\u201d). Unlike existing campaign finance law, which regulates speech that either expressly advocates a candidate\u2019s election or defeat or that mentions a candidate in relatively close temporal proximity to an election, the vague and overly broad new definition of PASO communications applies year-round and threatens to consume any legislative advocacy that dares mention an elected official. The penalties imposed by H.R. 1 for engaging in PASO communications are severe \u2013 a group that spends more than an aggregate of $10,000 on such communications over a two-year election cycle must, among other things, file reports publicly disclosing all of its donors who have given it more than $10,000 during the election cycle. As in previous versions of the DISCLOSE Act, the $10,000 donor threshold appears designed to target business organizations while largely sparing labor organizations from disclosure of their funding sources, which are typically union dues that are far less than $10,000.","Over the past several Congresses, various iterations of the legislation known as the DISCLOSE Act have been introduced. The profound constitutional problems of that legislation are well documented and include: (1) that it sought to chill associational and speech rights guaranteed by the First Amendment by threatening donor disclosure for groups engaged in advocacy; (2) that it provided for unequal treatment of speakers, severely burdening the business community while leaving unions largely unaffected; and (3) that it sought to deter speech through the imposition of unnecessarily burdensome disclaimers and reporting requirements. Remarkably, H.R. 1 takes the worst ideas and impulses of the DISCLOSE Act and expands upon them in ways that have incredibly harmful \u2013 and unconstitutional \u2013 consequences.","The reconciliation bill would give federal agencies additional power to place fines on small businesses.

American small businesses, self-employed workers, and independent contractors need and expect the type of bipartisan cooperation that led to the CARES Act to solve this immediate crisis.\u201d","Not surprisingly, the most populous states of California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Illinois topped the list in terms of the most independent contractors per state, but it also showed that 13 states have more than 500,000 people working as independent contractors and 38 states have at least 100,000 independent workers.","Further, the dataset shows the top five independent contractor industries:","\u201cTwenty-three million American support themselves and their families through work as an independent contractor. Whether it is in construction or real-estate, delivery services or entertainment, or the hundreds of other independent contractor occupations, these individuals are a critical element of our economy.

The guide provides step-by-step assistance to help individuals understand eligibility requirements, borrowing limits, and appropriate use of funds under the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. It also outlines the steps required to apply for Unemployment Compensation under a special program created by the CARES Act.","According to IRS data from 2016, nearly 23 million Americans earn wages as independent contractors working either part or full-time. Of those 23 million independent contractors, less than 2 million (8.6%) earn wages as part of the on-demand economy.","The guide for independent contractors and self-employed individuals is available at uschamber.com/ICguide. The Spanish version of the guide can be found at uschamber.com/ICGuideESP","Beginning on April 7, independent contractors receiving 1099-MISC forms and self-employed individuals were eligible to apply for the Paycheck Protection Program loan as part of the $2 trillion CARES Act. While these loans are potentially 100% forgivable, loan commitments have reportedly reached the maximum total of $349 billion available in the Paycheck Protection Program. Earlier today, the Chamber urged congressional leaders to restore this needed CARES Act funding.","Fourth and finally, any proposed change should enable, and not inhibit, the growth of the internet economy, which encompasses applications, business models, and sectors across the entire internet ecosystem. The internet economy is essential to continued U.S. global competitiveness and to providing critical services and products to consumers. The Department of Commerce estimates that the output of the U.S. digital economy exceeded $2 trillion in 2019, a $700 billion increase from 2010 (28). In fact, the internet economy grew seven times faster than the overall U.S. economy over the last four years (29). The number of jobs supported by internet related activities is estimated at 3 million in the U.S. alone (30). Many of these gains can be attributed to new business models and innovations, ranging from social media, e-commerce, the gig economy, and business to business providers.","Creating sustainable revenue based on an activity that directly benefits people in need is rare and difficult to achieve, and emocha helps customers fulfill their responsibility to secure medication adherence, which generates huge cost savings.

(Case No. 10-RC-276292) in response to the NLRB's invitation for briefs addressing whether the Board should reconsider its standard for determining the independent contractor status of workers.","The Deputy Assistant Secretary for OSHA issued the walk-around letter to the Steelworkers union in response to an inquiry it had submitted.  That inquiry came in the form a letter from the union asking \u201cwhether workers at a workplace without a collective bargaining agreement may authorize a person who is affiliated with a union or a community organization to act as their representative\u201d during OSHA inspections.","For good measure, the letter finally offered that \u201cworkers in some situations may feel uncomfortable talking to an OSHA [inspector] without the trusted presence of a representative of their choosing.\u201d  All of that, of course, was a thinly-veiled way of justifying the presence of a union organizer in order to facilitate unionizing efforts.","The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently reversed a controversial, albeit obscure, Obama-era policy that had opened the door for union organizers to accompany OSHA inspectors on visits to non-union workplaces. The reversal overturned the agency\u2019s so-called \u201cwalk-around letter\u201d from 2013 that had abrogated some four decades of accepted practice and caused angst for employers already beleaguered by an administration bent on using public policy to serve organized labor.","All of the PRO Act provisions in the Education and Labor language will be challenged under the so-called Byrd Rule on the Senate side.  Given that these provisions have next to nothing to do with outlays or revenues, it is difficult to see how most, if any, of it would survive a \u201cByrd bath.\u201d  That said, the Senate parliamentarian works in something of a black box, and until this language is actually stricken, it remains a significant concern.","It appropriates $350,000,000 for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), above its request of $301,900,000, and it authorizes the use of up to $5,000,000 for the purpose of implementing an electronic voting system for representation elections.","Director and officer personal liability for ULPs, which will be assessed at the discretion of the NLRB.","Communicating or misrepresenting to an individual that they are not an employee under the NLRA\u2019s definition.

As expected, it included the penalty language of the PRO Act and a few other provisions from the bill.","This iteration of the PRO Act includes even more harmful provisions than earlier versions from past Congresses. The PRO Act would radically rewrite American labor policy and eliminate any sense of balance that has existed since Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935. The bill would deliberately eliminate basic rights for employers, such as the fundamental right to have standing in representation cases before the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). New to this version of the bill are provisions that allow unions to demand mail-in ballots in lieu of the private-ballot process administered by the NLRB and that codify the so-called \u201celection bar\u201d doctrine prohibiting a decertification election prior to the end of an existing contract.","The PRO Act would impede the economic recovery through its many harmful labor and employment policies.  The Chamber strongly urges you to vote against this deeply flawed bill.","The PRO Act would apply nationwide the problematic definition of independent contractors enacted by California in a statute known as AB-5. That statute has made the legitimate use of independent contractors extremely difficult in the state. It is causing significant challenges for a wide array of businesses and has resulted in job losses. This restrictive definition should not be imposed on the rest of the country.","Finally, the bill would codify an unrealistic standard for joint-employer liability adopted by the NLRB in 2015. Doing so would impose liability based on \u201cindirect\u201d or \u201cpotential\u201d control rather than on the clear standard that governed for decades. It would make employers liable for workers they don\u2019t actually employ and workplaces they don\u2019t actually control.","The PRO Act would further undermine the private ballot provisions in the NLRA by instead steering union certification elections towards a \u201ccard check\u201d process. Under card check, workers would have to publicly sign cards indicating their support or opposition to a union. This has the obvious potential to expose workers to harassment and intimidation. The bill would violate worker privacy by forcing employers to turn over to unions a great deal of information about their workers, including names, home addresses, personal home and cell phone numbers, e-mail addresses, shift schedules, and work locations. Under this legislation, workers could not opt-out from this disclosure. This legislation would also effectively repeal state right-to-work laws in the 27 states that currently have them. Doing so would force workers to pay union dues in order to keep their jobs in workplaces that are unionized.","In a decision that strains credulity, an Alameda County, Calif., Superior Court judge on August 20 issued a ruling that declared unconstitutional and unenforceable that state\u2019s Proposition 22, a ballot initiative that voters passed into law decisively in the November 2020 election.  The law defines drivers for app-based transportation platforms such as Uber and Lyft and delivery platforms like DoorDash and Instacart as independent contractors rather than as employees. It passed by a vote of 59% to 41%, but the judge apparently didn\u2019t like the result.","As this blog reported at the time, the Supreme Court of California n 2018 issued a decision inDynamex Operations West, Inc., in which it tossed out its own test for determining independent contractor status and replaced it with a version of the so-called ABC test. In doing so, the court wrote the new test in such a way as to make it difficult to classify an individual as an independent contractor unless that person has essentially no connection to the business in question.","Nevertheless, Judge Frank Roesch concluded in his decision that Proposition 22 violates the state constitution because it would prevent the legislature from granting workers\u2019 compensation to the app-based drivers. Because the state constitution grants \u201cplenary power\u201d to the legislature to establish a workers\u2019 compensation program, he reasoned, Proposition 22 impermissibly would remove app-based drivers from California\u2019s program, which covers them because of AB 5.","Judge Roesch further concluded that Proposition 22 violated the state constitution\u2019s single subject requirement for initiatives because it purportedly included a prohibition on legislation authorizing collective bargaining for app-based drivers. While the measure does include a prohibition on legislation that could be read in such a way, the major flaw in the judge\u2019s reasoning is that the state can\u2019t authorize collective bargaining because that issue is preempted by federal law. Thus, the judge\u2019s objection in this regard seems to be gratuitous at best.","Meanwhile, activist politicians filed a lawsuit against the main targets of AB 5, Uber and Lyft, both of which nearly ceased operations in California before a state appeals court provided them a temporary reprieve in August 2020.  Having been unable to persuade the legislature to reconsider AB 5, the companies and the broader business community decided to present the issue to the public in the election using California\u2019s ballot initiative mechanism. As noted previously, when given the opportunity to weigh in, voters approved Proposition 22 by a substantial margin.","Following that decision, the California legislature got in on the act by passing the Dynamex standard into law the next year with a statute known as AB 5. The ramifications of AB 5 were felt almost immediately after it took effect, and it left businesses either to assume all of the attendant liability associated with an employer-employee relationship or to stop using the services of independent contractors who did not meet the ABC test. The law was so disruptive that it forced the legislature to pass a series of exemptions for various industries reliant on independent contractors, many of whom saw their lives upended and livelihoods destroyed.","Not to be outdone, the state legislature, at the urging of organized labor, decided to codify the DynamexABC test in 2019, which it did by passing AB 5. The upshot of the revised test was that it became much harder for someone to be classified legally as an independent contractor, leaving employers either to assume all of the liability associated with an employer-employee relationship or to stop using the services of independent contractors who did not meet AB 5\u2019s stringent test.","For their part, opponents of AB 5 began the effort to pass a ballot initiative to exempt app-based drivers and delivery workers from the law and thereby allow them to remain independent contractors. To be sure, organized labor, which was eager to unionize the thousands of workers who would be forced into employment relationships, campaigned vehemently against Proposition 22 with its usual overheated rhetoric, but in the end voters apparently were not swayed. Given the popularity of things like ridesharing and on-demand delivery, it seems that there are some limits to what the public will, or won\u2019t, support just because labor leaders tell them to.","In the days after an election, one can find countless articles analyzing the results of myriad races, and to be sure, this year is no exception. While some aspects of the 2020 election remain unresolved one item of interest in California was settled decisively. By a vote of 58.4% to 41.6%, voters in the Golden State passed a ballot measure\u2014Proposition 22\u2014which was a repudiation of the state legislature\u2019s ill-conceived law known as AB 5.  As readers of this blog know, AB-5 sought to make the use of independent contractors in certain industries nearly impossible.","It did not take very long after AB 5 went into effect this year for enforcement efforts to begin, and on May 5, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, as well as the city attorneys of San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit against the popular rideshare companies  Uber and Lyft alleging that they were violating the law through their use of independent contractors who drive utilizing the companies\u2019 rider-driver pairing technology. By October, the legal case seemed destined to go against the companies when the First District Court of Appeal, Division Four issued a 74-page opinion ordering them to classify drivers using their respective platforms as employees rather than independent contractors.","Although Proposition 22 did not undo AB 5 altogether, by its terms drivers for app-based rideshare and delivery companies can remain independent contractors rather than employees provided that a company using their services do not set their hours, require the acceptance of specific ride or delivery requests, or restrict their ability to work for other companies.","Meanwhile, the legislature received enough backlash from individuals whose lives it had upended that it later passed legislation to provide dozens of exceptions for certain industries, which one might say is not the hallmark of well-made legislation in the first instance. However, it did no such thing for the gig economy companies that AB 5 had targeted.","The passage of Proposition 22 culminates, at least in large part, a legal tug-of-war that has been happening for over two years. It began with the California Supreme Court, which in 2018 unilaterally changed its standard for interpreting whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor. The Court\u2019s decision in a case known as Dynamex rewrote the existing law and adopted a modified \u201cABC\u201d test for evaluating an employment relationship.  The ABC test is known as such because it uses three factors (A,B, and C) to evaluate an independent contractor relationship.  Flunk any one of the three factors and a worker becomes an employee.  Critically, Dynamex  removed an important element of Part B of the test that had facilitated business relationships with independent contractors in other states using an ABC test of their own.","Will the ETS cover individual independent contractors that are engaged by a company with more than 100 employees?","It\u2019s not a challenge unique to Mexico or the U.S. as governments around the world struggle to strike the right balance on these issues. But the sheer magnitude, success, and importance of the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship makes the stakes much higher than the average commercial partnership. Misaligned policy in the short-term is likely to produce serious long-term consequences at a time when the two countries need each other more than ever.","The U.S. Department of Labor today announced that its final rule on independent contractors will be published in the Federal Register on January 7.

If the amount of the SFA is interpreted narrowly such that the plans would otherwise become insolvent in 2051, employers will face the option of withdrawing now or waiting until 2051 when the plan inevitably goes insolvent. As many employers are at the point, or will be soon, where withdrawal liability now is the cheaper option, there is no incentive to remain in the plan when remaining in the plan will only extend the duration of future withdrawal liability payments. In addition, unions will have no reason to push for continuation of these plans when the retired or soon to be retired employees are protected until approximately 2051 by the SFA, and the younger active employees know they will receive little or nothing for their pension contributions because the plan is sure to be insolvent before or shortly after they retire.","Under ARPA, a plan that receives SFA will be considered to be in critical status through the 2051 plan year. A plan that is in critical status must have a rehabilitation plan that provides for a reduction in future benefit accruals and/or an increase in contributions so that the plan may emerge from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period (i.e. 10 years or longer if a plan cannot emerge within 10 years).6 Special rules apply between the period the plan is certified as critical and before the rehabilitation plan is adopted by an employer in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA). During this time, the trustees cannot accept a CBA that provides for a reduction in the level of contributions for any participant, a suspension of contribution with regard to any period of service or any new or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees from plan participation.7 These restrictions do not apply after the rehabilitation plan is adopted. After the first year, the trustees must annually update the rehabilitation plan, including updating the schedule of contributions rates to reflect the plan experience.","Unions recognize the benefits of arbitration, which is why they have fought to ensure that they are excluded from the effects of the FAIR Act. The FAIR Act expressly allows labor unions to continue to benefit from pre-dispute arbitration agreements both in disputes with other unions and in disputes with companies.","So today I want to discuss something more enduring than a set of numbers from a moment in time\u2014and that is the role of the American Dream\u2014or, more accurately, the countless American dreams that together have propelled our nation forward for more than 240 years.You might say that the original American dreamers were the founders of our government who conceived a more perfect union,\xa0who led the grand experiment of a new republic anchored in religious, personal, and economic freedom.American dreamers took that freedom and ran with it.They applied their ideas, talent, and toil to great American feats\u2014the transcontinental railroad,\xa0the assembly line,\xa0the interstate highway system,\xa0the personal computer,\xa0the worldwide web, the Internet of Things.\xa0These and other innovations have allowed generations of Americans to pursue their unique dreams.[Free Enterprise:\xa0How a Gut Feeling Led this Dream Big Winner to Open Her Own Business]The Chamber\u2019s agenda for 2019 and beyond is built around this simple idea\u2014to harness our new-found economic strength, do everything we can to keep it going, and put it to work on behalf of Americans who hope for a shot at their own unique American dream.","The Chamber submitted comments to the\xa0FTC and DOJ\xa0in response to their solicitation for public comments in connection with their recent workshop, \u201cMaking Competition Work: Promoting Competition in Labor Markets.\u201d In the comments, the Chamber urged the agencies to avoid promulgating rules regarding competition in labor markets and rules regarding collective bargaining.","Unfortunately, many lawsuits lack merit or are more frivolous than others.

Meanwhile, individuals who until recently had provided services ranging from language interpretation to playing Santa Claus were not so lucky.","The result was as a debacle as predictable as it was far-reaching. The broad scope of AB 5\u2019s language created a potential liability for countless businesses that could not afford to take on new employees, so they simply severed ties or otherwise found ways to work around the law.  The response from the newly unemployed was equally negative.  Individuals who previously had offered services as independent contractors in myriad industries demanded that they be exempted from AB 5, so lawmakers scrambled to do so almost as soon as AB 5 took effect. AB 2257 is just the latest iteration of changes, and more will likely come, underscoring again AB 5\u2019s faults.","Coordinate unified responses to state-level policies that pose national threats, such as the A.B. 5 independent contractor law in California.","Strongly oppose the amendment offered by Rep.

Uber\u2019s \u201cUberX\u201d service debuted in July 2012, and Lyft entered the market in August 2012. Economic research has shown that the emergence of ride-hailing services increased competition. Thus, the substantial increase in industrial concentration associated with the taxi service industry was the direct result of new entry into the market.","The ranks of the \u201dBuild by the Fourth of July\u201d coalition grew to more than 300 groups\u2014a diverse alliance including the North America\u2019s Building Trades Unions, leading environmental advocacy organizations, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, as well as other leading business, policy and labor organizations.","The penalties imposed by H.R. 1 for engaging in PASO communications are severe \u2013 a group that spends more than an aggregate of $10,000 on such communications over a two-year election cycle must, among other things, file reports publicly disclosing all of its donors who have given it more than $10,000 during the election cycle. The $10,000 donor threshold appears designed to target business organizations while largely sparing labor organizations from disclosureof their funding sources, which are typically union dues that are far less than $10,000.","The state of the union is strong when the state of American business is strong\u2014and when we are a clear voice and a strong model for freedom and free enterprise in the world.","Tonight, we will be watching as President Biden gives his State of the Union address to a nation burdened with economic challenges and a world in crisis.","The SEIU\u2019s latest LM-2 shows that the union had total receipts around $304 million in 2016, which is the lowest amount since 2007\u2014in fact, in nominal terms it\u2019s a drop of more than $100 million from 2012.  On the spending side, the SEIU disbursed approximately $314 million, also a drop of more than $100 million since 2012.","The question for dues-paying SEIU members is just what the union is getting for this largesse.  Certainly Fight for $15 has achieved a few policy successes in terms of raising the minimum wage in some states and localities.  But in its central purpose\u2014the unionization of the fast food industry\u2014the campaign has led to no new union members.  In fact, SEIU membership has gone down since Fight for $15 started.  Still, the SEIU had hopes that policies pushed by a friendly administration, namely forcing franchisors into joint employment relationships with franchisees, would provide fuel for the campaign.  The election of Donald Trump is likely to bring an end to that prospect once new National Labor Relations Board members are installed and reexamine the previous Board\u2019s","While spending may have dipped overall, the union continued to shell out large sums for its Fight for $15 campaign.  In 2016, $14 million was devoted to the cause, bringing the total since the campaign was launched to nearly $70 million (this is a very conservative estimate, the actual total is likely to be significantly higher).","The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) recently submitted to the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) its annual financial report for 2016.  The report, known as the LM-2, is required by law and provides detailed information about the union\u2019s receipts and expenses, as well as payments to individual officers and employees.","The SEIU\u2019s latest LM-2 shows that the union had total receipts around $314 million in 2017, which is about $10 million higher than the previous year, but it still represents a relatively low amount compared to five years prior, when the SEIU\u2019s receipts were $411 million.  The SEIU\u2019s total disbursements amounted to $273 million, approximately $41.5 million less than the prior year and a whopping $180 million decrease compared to 2012.","The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) recently submitted to the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) its annual financial report for 2017.  The report, known as the LM-2, is required by law and provides detailed information about the union\u2019s receipts and expenses, as well as payments to individual officers and employees.","As this blog has observed before, the SEIU has poured millions of dollars\u2014at least $70 million, which is a conservative estimate\u2014in the last several years for the Fight for $15 with little to show for its \u201cinvestment.\u201d  The SEIU\u2019s real objective all along has been to garner more members by organizing the fast food industry, but despite its efforts, membership has not changed much.  The union reported a total of 1,919,358 members, which is in fact higher than in 2012 when it started the Fight for $15, but still lower than one year before that, when membership stood at 1,921,768.","To be fair, the Fight for $15 has succeeded in enacting inflated minimum wage ordinances in numerous localities and a handful of states.  As an aside, however, it is worth noting that organized labor often employs a cynical tactic in doing so by seeking an exemption from the higher minimum wage for employers with a unionized workforce. In other words, if an employer accepts unionization, they could potentially negotiate a lower wage\u2014it\u2019s a win-win deal, except for the workers of course.","In response to inquiries about the SEIU\u2019s funding for the Fight for $15, a spokesperson denied that the union was abandoning its campaign, saying that it was merely \u201cshifting gears\u201d by shuffling money to different areas that purportedly would not be reflected in the LM-2 report.  Of course, since all of the union\u2019s expenditures are required by law to be included on the report, it is unclear as to how the SEIU would omit money spent elsewhere.","Either way, after several years and several million dollars, it appears that the SEIU\u2019s leadership has finally decided to substantially curtail the union\u2019s funding for the Fight for $15, which is a positive development for the union members whose dues have sustained the whole thing.","Perhaps the most revealing detail in the SEIU\u2019s report is that the union slashed funding for its Fight for $15 campaign for an inflated minimum wage. In 2016, the SEIU spent nearly $15 million for the various organizing committees responsible for orchestrating the campaign, but in 2017 the SEIU\u2019s funding for them dropped dramatically to $7.8 million.","As the NLRB acknowledged, the union involved, the nascent Amazon Labor Union (ALU), first filed an election petition on October 25, 2021, but withdrew it because it had not demonstrated the required 30% showing of interest among employees. The ALU filed a second petition on December 22, 2021, and after nearly two months of negotiating, Amazon and the union agreed on terms to hold the impending election.","On March 17, an NLRB Regional Director filed a petition in federal court seeking an injunction under Section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The petition asked the court to force Amazon to rehire an employee who had been fired from his job at the company\u2019s fulfillment center in Staten Island, NY (known as its JFK8 facility). Despite the drama of using 10(j), this termination was hardly an emergency, in fact it took place a full 23 months ago.","The NLRB has a history of this type of behavior, such as when the Board tried to force the Cooper Tire & Rubber Company to rehire a worker who had used ethnic slurs on the picket line.\xa0 Apparently, the NLRB has now come full circle and thinks that \u201cdisparaging verbal attacks\u201d should be an acceptable part of the workplace environment.\xa0 Someone might want to alert the EEOC.","What makes this situation worse is the fact that employees at the JFK8 facility are about to have a union representation election, and the NLRB\u2019s sudden demand for an injunction seems dubiously timed to sway voters.","Despite its ostensible role as a neutral arbiter, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has a penchant for tilting the field in favor of labor unions depending on who is running the agency. Its most recent shenanigan involving the retail giant Amazon\u2014a curiously-timed court petition\u2014 is an unfortunate example of this phenomenon.","In none of that intervening time\u2014not to mention any time prior\u2014 had the NLRB sought an injunction regarding the terminated employee. Yet, just as ballots are about to be cast, the agency maintains that Amazon should be forced not only to rehire the terminated employee (even if it means firing someone else), but also post copies of the court\u2019s order (should it issue one)\u2014both in English and Spanish\u2014\u201cin all breakrooms, bathrooms, and bathroom stalls\u201d at Amazon\u2019s JFK8 facility. It also asked the court to require Amazon to hold one or more mandatory employee meetings at which company management would read the court\u2019s order aloud. \xa0It seems obvious that all of this would paint Amazon in a less than flattering light.\xa0 The NLRB frequently cites employers for disturbing the \u201claboratory conditions\u201d it seeks to maintain during an election.\xa0 The agency is not supposed to disturb those conditions itself.","According to the NLRB, Amazon\u2019s decision to fire the employee was illegal because it violated the NLRA\u2019s protection of concerted activity, as the employee was engaged in protests over Amazon\u2019s COVID-19 policies. Amazon maintains that the employee was terminated because he \u201cpublicly, viciously, and profanely berated a female coworker over a bullhorn and social media broadcasts,\u201d which it called a \u201cvile, offensive, and disparaging verbal attack \u2026 that no employer ever would\u2014or should\u2014tolerate or accept in a civilized workplace.\u201d According to at least one news report about the language used, Amazon\u2019s characterization would seem pretty accurate.","As observers of labor policy know, the NLRB has a questionable record when it comes to employer policies such as requiring civility in the workplace. During the Obama administration, the NLRB attacked such policies and deemed them illegal. In those days, the Board believed that requiring courtesy in the workplace interfered with organizing rights, and it seems the current Board is taking the same view.","On its website, the RWDSU states that \u201cunion workers are 54 percent more likely to have employer-provided pensions\u2026\u201d\xa0 And indeed, most RWDSU members are part of the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store International Union and Industry Pension Fund (Pension Fund).","Given the high costs associated with multiemployer plans that are in critical status and the risk that workers will see benefits that are less than contributions, assuming they actually meet the five-year vesting requirement, a much better solution would be for workers and employers to contribute to a 401(k) individual account that the employee owns.\xa0 But don\u2019t expect unions to embrace that solution any time soon.","But there\u2019s a bit of a problem.\xa0 The Pension Fund is considered in \u201ccritical\u201d status by the federal government.\xa0 It is just 68.4% funded and has a nine-to-one ratio of retirees to active employees\u2014meaning simply that more people are taking out than are putting in.\xa0 Finally, union pension plans typically have a five-year vesting window, in an industry where workers switch jobs frequently.\xa0 So a worker could put money in without a chance to take it out at retirement, unless they take a job at another company that is part of the same pension plan.","Unionized workers typically are part of what\u2019s called a multiemployer pension plan, and it works much differently than what most people are used to. Most workers today contribute some of their paycheck to a 401(k) account, money that is always theirs, and their employer makes a matching contribution that also belongs to the employee, generally after working three years. When the employee leaves, the account belongs to the employee to do what she wants with it.","Ahead of the Union Election at Amazon, NLRB Files Questionable Petition","Recently, this blog highlighted the continuing decline in union membership. There are likely many explanations for that decline. Nevertheless, unions have some selling points to recruit new members. One is the promise of a stable pension in retirement. But this promise doesn\u2019t always bear out. Take, for example, the main pension plan of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union (RDSWU).","For example, would a contractor be required to report a violation under OSHA if a citation had been challenged at the administrative law judge level (the first level of adjudication) but the company intended to appeal it further to the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and then to federal court? If a company settles an OSHA violation noted during an inspection but files a notification for modification of abatement, is that deemed a reportable event under the proposed AGAR clause? If the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (that enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act) declines to proceed with a discrimination charge but the employee has not acted on their Notice of Right to Sue, would that be considered adjudicated? Or what is the status if a charge is settled or mediated before any agency determination? Similarly, what level of adjudication triggers reporting of an unfair labor practice charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board? ULPs are a frequent pressure tactic of unions when seeking to unionize a company or during contract negotiations. Furthermore, every statute cited in the list of reportable labor law violations has its own investigation, enforcement and remedial provision to be enforced by a government agency or a private allegedly aggrieved individual or party. Thus, there is no void left to be filled by superimposing a non-related procurement obligation on top of an already long-standing and legally defined enforcement process for labor and employment laws dating back to the 1930\u2019s. There is no reason to believe Department of Agriculture contracting officers bring any special expertise to this process.","The rulemaking does not comply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Related          A Union Wins at Amazon \u2013 With a Little Help","Furthermore, if enacted, this requirement would deny due process to federal contractors and would provide leverage for unions and other parties to exert pressure on companies with federal contracts, which could lead to a variety of additional problems for the government and private federal contracting community. It may harm competition and could lead to high-performing businesses, including small businesses and those owned by women or persons of color, being excluded from the federal contracting process. It could result in job losses, as suspended or debarred federal contractors would be forced to lay off employees if denied the ability to compete for federal contracts. This would likely have a ripple effect of job losses through the federal contracting supply chain and negatively impact agency missions.","S. 3410 would strike a balance and provide tools for the FTC to collect monetary damages and safeguards for businesses.

These plans typically cover unionized workers who move from job to job throughout their careers. It is no exaggeration to say that these plans face a crisis. There is currently a shortfall of more than $124 billion in these plans. Roughly 1,141 of these plans, covering 1.3 million workers, face more than $36 billion in shortfalls and are likely to start going bankrupt in as little as five years... ...","Last Thursday, aviation leaders convened in Washington, D.C., for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s annual Aviation Summit. All aspects of the industry were represented\u2014from airlines and manufacturers to unions and regulatory agencies. There was a lot to talk about.","The Miguel Trujillo Lopez Trade Union stated its respect for the employees who voted to terminate the current agreement. GM also announced its respect for the outcome and said it will continue to abide by the current agreement until employees vote on a new contract.","Mexican government officials, members of the International Labor Organization, and representatives from the National Electoral Institute observed close to 6,000 GM employees cast a vote deciding whether to reinstate the Miguel Trujillo Lopez Trade Union collective bargaining agreement. 3,214 employees cast the majority vote to terminate the collective agreement, potentially opening the door for the workers at the Silao plant to vote on new union representation. Alternatively, there is a possibility that the current union will attempt to negotiate a new contract with the facility\u2019s workers. Workers could also attempt to form their own independent union. More will likely be known after Mexico\u2019s labor inspectorate reviews and certifies last week\u2019s vote.","While the GM case is slowing down, labor reform in Mexico is not. Votes to legitimize all current collective bargaining agreements will begin this October in 13 Mexican states.

In a series of cases, the Trump Board issued various decisions that addressed employers\u2019 obligations to recognize or bargain with a union in different circumstances, which provided employers greater flexibility in contrast to decisions issued during the Obama administration.","The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has a new sheriff, so to speak, in the person of Jennifer Abruzzo, who was confirmed as the agency\u2019s General Counsel in July, and while her confirmation is only a few weeks old, she is making it clear she that she has her own agenda.","Burden of proof for establishing anti-union animus. In its 2019 Tschiggfrie Properties, Ltd., decision, the Board overturned an Obama-era decision and narrowed its \u201cWright Line\u201d test for determining anti-union animus by holding that \u201cevidence of animus must support finding that a causal relationship exists between the employee\u2019s protected activity and the employer\u2019s adverse action against the employee.\u201d","On August 12, Abruzzo issued a  guidance memo in which she signaled her priorities by defining what types of cases must be presented to the Office of General Counsel\u2019s (OGC) Division of Advice. Since the General Counsel serves as the NLRB\u2019s prosecutor, such submissions will allow Abruzzo to tee up cases involving issues of particular interest for the Board to consider, which will be particularly useful once the Democrats regain the majority on August 27 given their determination to reverse many of the Trump-era decisions.","The Employee handbook.During the Obama administration, the NLRB became so fixated on nitpicking employers\u2019 workplace policies that the U.S. Chamber published an entire report highlighting the theater of the absurd that had resulted. The current Board tried to restore some semblance of sanity with its 2017 ruling in Boeing, which created a more reasonable framework for evaluating the legality of workplace rules.","Employer obligations after contract expiration.Under longstanding precedent dating back to the 1960s, the Board had held that an employer\u2019s obligation to check off union dues ends when its collective-bargaining agreement containing a checkoff provision expires, but the Obama-era Board overturned that with its 2015 Lincoln Lutheran of Racine decision. The Trump-era Board restored the prior interpretation in Valley Hospital Medical Center in 2019, which overturned Lincoln Lutheran.","Independent contractors. During the Trump administration, the Board clarified the standards for classifying individuals as independent contractors rather than employees in its Velox Expressand SuperShuttle decisions. Together, those reversed the Board\u2019s 2014 decision in FedEx Home Delivery that limited the significance of an individual\u2019s entrepreneurial opportunity and the common-law agency test for classification purposes.","Union access to employer property. The Trump-era Board upheld employers\u2019 ability to control their own private property by prohibiting access to public spaces (e.g., a cafeteria) and to employers\u2019 emails systems by non-employees for promotional or organizational activity. That holding overturned previous rulings that union organizers could not be denied such access.","Economic experts agree that the initial spending and transfer payments will add to near-term inflationary pressures, further harming American families and businesses who are already suffering from higher prices on everything from food to energy. The proposed tax increases, including a new corporate minimum tax on book income, a new tax on stock buybacks, and tax increases on U.S. business income earned abroad, will harm the recovery and hamstring America as we work to compete globally, especially with China. The pharmaceutical price controls could result in fewer drugs being introduced to the U.S. market in the coming decades.\u202f America may miss out on the next vaccine or treatment for the next pandemic because of these short-sighted policies.\u202f Anti-energy provisions in the bill would increase the cost of energy for all Americans and could lead to energy supply shortages and power outages while prices are already the highest in a decade, squander domestic energy security, and threaten the supply chain for clean energy technologies. The bill would also overturn nearly 90 years of labor law to tilt the playing field in favor of unions by threatening employers of all sizes with bankruptcy-inducing civil penalties that do not exist in current law. Finally, because of various budget gimmicks, including sunsetting new programs, in some cases after only one year, the true cost of the proposed bill is significantly higher than the nearly $2 trillion that is advertised.","The bill is called the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act. Put simply, it\u2019s a wish-list for labor unions desperate to add new members.","The PRO Act has already passed the House, and President Biden can\u2019t wait to sign it. Only the Senate is holding the line, and one key reason for that is that Arizona\u2019s Senators, Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema, have not signed onto this bill, which has 47 Senate co-sponsors \u2014 all Democrats.","Union leaders are currently touring the country making misleading arguments about a bill you may not have heard of, but that \u2014 should it pass \u2014 would make radical and harmful changes to your workplace.","Key Stat: In addition to the 10,000s of corporate executives that direct selling employees in the U.S., the channel provides entrepreneurial opportunities to 7.7 million American independent contractors that sell products and services. These direct sellers value the flexibility and ability to make a supplemental income that direct selling provides.","Lastly, the report focuses on the Service Employees International Union\u2019s (SEIU) efforts to prop up various worker center entities in its ongoing crusade for an inflated $15 minimum wage.  The study concludes that the SEIU spent more than $55 million from 2013-16 for the operating expenses of several \u201corganizing committees\u201d in various locations across the country.  (As this blog has noted before, the SEIU has spent $72 million overall since starting the Fight for $15 five years ago, but it has yielded few, if any, new members for the union.)","Next, the report provides a general analysis of different foundations\u2019 patterns of grant-making as well as the recipients of various grants based on the two categories of direct vs. indirect funding.  Among the grant recipients, the largest groups in descending order include the National Domestic Workers Alliance, the Restaurant Opportunities Center, the New Orleans Workers Center for Racial Justice, the National Day Laborers Organizing Network, the Farmworker Association of Florida, the Workers Defense Project, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, the Southwest Workers Union, and the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance.  The report also identifies various sources of funding for each group.","As WFI\u2019s 2013 report noted, worker centers are not a new phenomenon, but they have taken on an increasingly central role in advancing the agenda of organized labor.  The current report demonstrates that they continue to receive substantial funding both from labor unions as well as private foundations.  To the extent that worker centers are engaging in activities more typically associated with unions, though, there could be legal implications worth considering, given the requirements imposed on labor groups imposed by the National Labor Relations Act and the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.  Either way, worker centers are a powerful force for organized labor worth watching closely.","The Workforce Freedom Initiative (WFI) today released a new report titled The Emerging Role of Worker Centers in Union Organizing: An Update and Supplement.  The report provides an updated analysis of so-called \u201cworker centers\u201d following a similar study released in 2013 that first examined the same topic.  As in the original report, the analysis shows that worker centers are an increasingly important and well-funded element of organized labor\u2019s strategy to advance its agenda, with tens of millions of dollars funneled to them by both unions and foundations.","Provide a safe harbor for businesses to provide independent contractors with PPE, cleaning supplies, safety training, and limited financial support without creating an employment relationship.\xa0 Likewise, ensure that providing such services to franchisees will not be considered evidence of a joint employer relationship.","In addition to the economic realities test, another test for determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor is known as the ABC test. An individual is classified as an employee unless they satisfy all three prongs: A) the individual is free from control and direction in connection with the performance of the service, both under the contract for the performance of service and in fact; B) the service is performed outside the usual course of the business of the employer; and C) the individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.\xa0 The ABC test makes finding an independent contracting relationship exceedingly difficult.\xa0 Dr. Weil stated at his confirmation hearing that an ABC test could only be implemented through legislation, not regulations. On this matter, we agree with Dr. Weil.","If confirmed, however, we are concerned Dr. Weil may seek to promulgate a regulation for determining independent contractor status under the FLSA that will reflect the AI he issued, which would perpetuate confusion and uncertainty for employers.","Employee versus Independent Contractor Classification Under the FLSA: Dr. Weil issued another AI that sought to clarify when a worker should be classified as an employee and when that worker can be considered an independent contractor. The AI relied on the \u201ceconomic realities\u201d test which includes several factors such as the nature and degree of the employer\u2019s control; the permanency of the worker\u2019s relationship with the employer; the amount of the worker\u2019s investment in facilities, equipment, or helpers; the amount of skill, initiative, judgment, and foresight required for the worker\u2019s services; the worker\u2019s opportunities for profit or loss; and the extent of the integration of the worker\u2019s services into the employer\u2019s business. Under the AI, all of these factors were to be considered together, with no specific factor or factors being considered more important than the others. Because of this, an employer would never be able to tell whether they had properly classified a worker as an employee or an independent contractor until the WHD made the determination. The AI was rescinded by the Trump DOL and replaced with a balanced regulation that ordered the various factors so that employers would be able to properly classify a worker as an employee or independent contractor. That regulation, too, has been rescinded by the current DOL, restoring the previous state of confusion and uncertainty to classification of employees.","As WHD Administrator during the Obama Administration, Dr. Weil advanced policy proposals on critical questions under the FLSA that would present significant challenges to employers and employees alike. Those proposals related to whether an employee would be exempt from overtime, finding joint employment relationships, and whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. His actions regarding these issues are detailed below.","In turn, Congress must act to ensure that U.S. workers, farmers, ranchers, and companies benefit from the market-opening reforms the Central Asian nation has begun. Specifically, Congress must pass a short and simple bill that grants Kazakhstan PNTR status and graduates the country from the requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. This measure was devised to press the Soviet Union to allow the emigration of Soviet Jews, prisoners of conscience, and victims of religious persecution.

However, actual protest activity appears to have been limited to a handful of major metropolitan areas.","As Labor Day approaches, the Fight for $15 is sticking to its mantra of an inflated minimum wage and a union.  For the SEIU, it must be concerning that neither slogan appears to be working.","Unlike many of the protests launched by the Service Employees International Union\u2019s (SEIU) Fight for $15 in recent years, organizers did not make lofty promises of nationwide protests in hundreds of cities. In fact, this round appears limited to Chicago and perhaps a few other locations in the Midwest.","Perhaps that economic reality accounts for the SEIU\u2019s own good-for-thee-but-not-for-me philosophy of not paying its own organizers a minimum wage of $15, something this blog chronicled last year.  If the Fight for $15\u2019s own organizers are to be believed, they earn as little as $9.10 per hour and have no union representation of their own because the SEIU uses third party organizations to avoid having to negotiate their wages.

These informational meetings take place during work hours, and employees are compensated at their regular rate of pay while attending.","Banning or restricting informational meetings would overturn decades of well-settled labor law, not to mention bump up against employer free speech rights. Yet that may not deter the current Board majority, which is seeking to overturn numerous precedents with blind determination. For employers, how the NLRB handles this issue could have significant implications.","Organized labor has long detested such meetings because they are opportunities for employers to provide information about unionization that labor organizers might not be eager to disclose as they attempt to garner support. For example, unions like the RWDSU certainly would not want prospective members to learn that their pension fund is in \u201ccritical\u201d status and may not be able to pay promised benefits.","On February 22, the RWDSU filed three ULP charges alleging unlawful coercive rules, coercive actions, and changes to the terms and conditions of employment.\xa0 According to news reports, the specific complaints include allegations that \u201cthe company removed pro-union literature from break rooms and limited workers\u2019 warehouse access to 30 minutes at the end of their shift to make it harder for organizers to talk to workers on-site.\u201d","What is significant about the RWDSU\u2019s complaint is that the union asked the NLRB to declare that employees may opt out of informational audience meetings held by company management.","In January, this blog reported on the ongoing drama surrounding the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union\u2019s (RWDSU) effort to organize workers at retail leader Amazon\u2019s distribution facility in Bessemer, Alabama. Barely a month later, the RWDSU is at it again, and this time, the union has filed unfair labor practice (ULP) charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) before the re-run election it asked for has even finished. It would seem the RWDSU is setting the stage to ask for yet another bite at the apple in case it loses this time as well. However, this set of complaints could have wider national implications.","While the plans are legally required to pay the premiums to the PBGC, plans only receive funds from employer contributions or investments.\xa0 To the extent premiums are increased, plans either will have to increase employer contributions (which cannot be done outside of the collective bargaining process) or decrease benefits to pay the increased premiums.","The change in the lookback period for determining highest contribution base units (to the highest CBU in the last 20 years versus the highest 3-year average during the past 10 years) could significantly increase the liability for many employers that are in declining industries or that experienced a spike in CBUs in a particular year. It would also discourage employers from adding contribution hours in any given year, even to address a temporary business need for increased union personnel.","Stabilizing the multiemployer pension plan system will involve significant costs.\xa0 These costs must be spread among all stakeholders in a fair and equitable manner because all stakeholders have acted in a responsible manner.\xa0 The retirees provided years of service in the workforce in exchange for a promised pension.\xa0 The contributing employers made the required contributions under their collective bargaining agreements and the governing rehabilitation plans. While no single group bears responsibility for the crisis, all stakeholders (including taxpayers) stand to suffer if the system is not stabilized. The Federal government also bears significant financial risk if the multiemployer system and PBGC are not stabilized because workers and retirees without pensions will rely on the Federal government for financial assistance. As such, all stakeholders must contribute toward a solution.","The proposal imposes a monthly $2.50 fee for each active employee under the collective bargaining agreement for each union and each participating employer.\xa0 Plans would be required to collect and transmit this amount monthly to the PBGC.","Present law does not impose a PBGC fee on contributing employers or unions.","If there is indeed a change in the rules for determining the discount rate despite these concerns, a longer transition period is needed because any change in the interest rate assumptions can have a dramatic impact on employer contributions. For example, based on the estimates in the GAO report, a 0.25% reduction in the discount rate could increase the value of plan liabilities by almost 4%. This increase in plan liabilities can only be addressed through increased contributions or benefit reductions, which will take time to implement. A five-year period is not long enough to transition to a new formula because these plans are subject to the collective bargaining cycle, which can vary from 3 to 5 years. As a result, plans would not immediately be able to adjust contribution rates, and the only way plans would be able to account for the increase in liabilities before the next collective bargaining agreement (CBA) would be to reduce benefits.","If an employer is not subject to a specific collective bargaining agreement requiring contributions to the plan, a copy of the participation agreement or other document governing the employer\u2019s contribution obligation;","Any final legislation should eliminate the union and employer copayment.","Working with Ending Child Prostitution and Trafficking and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as well as partnering with Uber in the Desert Region to help drivers identify potential human trafficking situations.","Last week the LyftUp Scooter Critical Workforce Program was launched to provide first responders, healthcare, and transit workers with free scooter trips as they serve the public on the frontlines.

What is noteworthy, perhaps, this year is that there were slightly more private sector union members (7.03 million) than public sector (6.98 million), which has not always been the case in recent years.","In other words, the addition of 4.2 million jobs in 2021 did not grow union membership, which is now down by more than half a million members in two years. Almost all those new jobs were in the private sector, and so was the decline in union membership.\xa0 In 2021, the private sector lost about 50,000 union members, for a total loss of about 478,000 since 2019. Meanwhile, the private sector union membership rate itself dipped slightly from 6.3% to 6.1%, the lowest it has ever been. Its previous low point was 6.2% in 2019.","Cue agencies like the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) especially, both of which are now populated by labor\u2019s political allies working to reshape labor policy to help stop the hemorrhaging. Meanwhile, organized labor leaders still hope to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would codify a litany of lopsided policies that would shoehorn more workers into labor unions. Though it passed the House last year, it remains stuck in the Senate, for now at least. Let\u2019s hope it stays that way. Maybe then union leaders will think of ways to improve their product that will convince more people to buy it willingly.","The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on January 21 released its annual union membership report for 2021. This year\u2019s report showed that union membership as a percentage of the workforce declined by half a percentage point from 10.8% to 10.3%, a drop that matches the lowest level on record set in 2019. As this blog observed about last year\u2019s report, there is a little more to the story due to the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.","The 10.8% membership rate in 2020 was up from 10.3%, but it was skewed by the loss of 9.6 million jobs, most of which were non-union. Despite the rate increase that year, union membership in whole numbers dropped by 321,000. While the union membership rate in 2021 returned percentagewise to where it had been in 2019, the number of union members fell another roughly 230,000.","This year\u2019s union membership report leaves much to be desired for organized labor leaders, to say the least. \xa0Indeed, it demonstrates yet another decline in a downward trend dating to 1955. \xa0Factoring out public sector unions, of which there were few, if any, back then, the decline amounts to about an 82% drop in union membership. Of course, public sector unions do exist, but the point is organized labor would be even more emaciated without them.","Ahead of the Union Election at Amazon, NLRB Files Questionable Petition","The story in the public sector was a little different but not necessarily much better. Despite losing 391,000 jobs in 2020, the public sector saw union membership increase by about 107,000 that year over 2019.\xa0 In 2021, however, the number employed in the public sector dipped slightly (by about 6,000), but union membership fell by about 181,000, almost a full percentage point from 34.8% to 33.9%.","For the last several years, organized labor has engaged in a multi-faceted campaign to raise the minimum wage to an inflated $15 per hour, and unions like the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) have funded the so-called Fight for $15 effort as a broader organizing effort.  Although the SEIU has yet to recruit any new members through this effort, the $15 minimum wage has still taken root in some cities and states dominated by their political allies.","Since then, the NLRB has revisited many of the lopsided, anti-employer policies implemented by the Obama-era Board and, to its credit, made a fair amount of progress in restoring its proper role as a neutral arbiter of labor law.

That did not happen until the end of September 2017 when Emmanuel joined the Board, paving the way for a more balanced approach.","Ahead of the Union Election at Amazon, NLRB Files Questionable Petition","If past experience is a guide, then one may expect a staunchly pro-union approach from both pending appointees. As this blog noted previously, however, these nominees\u2019 background is certain to raise controversy over recusal issues. For Prouty, his service at the SEIU is sure to call into question his participation in any cases involving that union and any of its subordinate bodies, which could prove tricky. Then again, the standard for evaluating conflicts of interest seems to have an interesting shapeshifting characteristic depending on who\u2019s in charge.  Either way,  employers may wish to brace themselves for whiplash.","Prouty\u2019s appointment, like Wilcox\u2019s, signals the current administration\u2019s tight relationship with organized labor and its interests. He currently serves as the general counsel for the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 32BJ, which represents just under 150,000 members in ten northeastern states, the District of Columbia, Florida and other parts of the United States.","The more worrisome aspect of a new Democratic majority at the NLRB will be a return to the misguided policies adopted during the Obama administration, of which there were many.  Indeed, there were so many harmful policy decisions during that time the U.S. Chamber published a report featuring the highlights.","Prouty\u2019s nomination follows that of Gwynne Wilcox, whose appointment to the Board was announced on May 26. If confirmed, the pair of nominees would join fellow Democrat Lauren McFerran, who currently serves as the Chairman despite being a minority of one on the Board. Confirmation of Prouty and Wilcox would flip control of the NLRB back to Democrats, who would hold a 3-2 majority for the first time in almost four years.","The restoration of a Democratic majority comes as no surprise given that the terms of NLRB members are staggered such that one term expires each year either in August or December and the party that controls the White House typically holds three seats. Given those facts, Emmanuel\u2019s replacement by a Democrat marks a rather typical personnel change associated with a new presidential administration.","S. 3143 protects victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment, while avoiding overbreadth that would prevent employees and businesses from using arbitration as a means of resolving disputes in other contexts. Nor does it contain a carve-out that would allow labor unions to use pre-dispute arbitration to resolve their disputes while denying the use of arbitration to others. Arbitration provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court. Empirical studies demonstrate that employees in arbitration do just as well, or in many circumstances, considerably better, than in court. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the flexibility of arbitration served complainants and businesses alike well as arbitration cases proceeded on schedule, while courthouses were forced to close their doors and developed significant backlogs that still present a challenge today.","Under the typical ABC test, employers must satisfy all three parts to classify someone as an independent contractor. Importantly, the \u201cB\u201d prong states that one can be considered an independent contractor if \u201cthe service is performed either outside the usual course of the business for which it is performed or is performed outside of all places of business of the enterprise for which it is performed.\u201d","In 2019, Assemblywoman Gonzalez introduced AB 5, which deliberately omitted the second element dealing with the location of the work performed, and the implication was immediately clear: businesses that procure the services of individuals who never even step foot into the business\u2019s physical location could no longer rely on that fact to classify someone as an independent contractor.","As this blog has observed previously, AB 5 enshrined into law a restrictive standard for determining whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor under California\u2019s wage and hour law. \xa0It did so by modifying what is known as the ABC test, which some states use for evaluating potential employer-employee relationships.","Just a few days into the new year, observers of labor policy received an unexpected gift of sorts on the 10th day of Christmas. Rather than ten lords a-leaping, however, it was the news on January 3 that California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the author of California\u2019s notorious independent contractor legislation known as AB 5, would resign her position within the week to work for the California Labor Federation (CLF).","To be fair, AB 5\u2019s modified ABC test was first articulated by the California Supreme Court the prior year, but once it became a law, it applied to all employers across the state, many of whom relied on independent contractors in a wide range of businesses.\xa0 As a result, AB 5 cast into doubt many longstanding relationships.","More particularly, it forced employers to reclassify erstwhile independent contractors as employees, which meant they would have to provide overtime, provide at least the minimum wage, be responsible for payroll taxes, and incur vicarious liability for them, among other things. If they failed to do so, employers could\u2014and did\u2014incur stiff penalties. It also meant that some workers lost the flexibility they had taken for granted, or worse, lost work entirely.","Ahead of the Union Election at Amazon, NLRB Files Questionable Petition","On Monday, October 26 2020, the Chamber submitted comments to the Department of Labor regarding RIN 1235-AA34--Independent Contractor Status under the Fair Labor Standards Act. These comments outline the importance of the gig economy and offers a number of recommendations.","With a new Democratic majority in place, observers of labor policy generally expect the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to adopt an aggressive stance when it comes to enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). For employers that the Board deems to have violated that law, one element of that stance will likely include remedial orders that include dubious requirements, such as mandating access to the employer\u2019s property or requiring the employer to read aloud a Board notice.","Ahead of the Union Election at Amazon, NLRB Files Questionable Petition","With regard to the order requiring union access to Sysco\u2019s facilities, the court noted that the union had collected authorization cards from almost 100 out of 162 employees and said that \u201cneither the General Counsel nor the Union has made any showing that Sysco prevented the [union] from reaching Sysco's employees.\u201d Thus, it concluded that  \u201c[o]rdering access to a company's facilities and employees \u2018cannot be justified as a remedial measure\u2019 unless it is \u2018necessary to offset the direct consequences or effects of an employer's unlawful conduct,\u2019\u201d which was not the case here.","The decision involved a case dating back to 2014, when several employees of the food supplier Sysco began an effort to unionize their workplace. After the organizing effort garnered enough support, an election was held, but the employees voted 82-71 against union representation. As might be expected, the union involved objected to the results and alleged that the employer had engaged in a variety of unfair labor practices.","To that end, the NLRB\u2019s General Counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, on September 8 released a guidance memo in which she directed the agency\u2019s regional offices to \u201crequest from the Board the full panoply of remedies available\u201d for alleged violations, including those two among others.","An administrative law judge agreed with the union and recommended an order requiring the company to recognize and bargain with the union based on its allegedly unlawful conduct.The NLRB reversed that aspect of the judge\u2019s recommendation but upheld others, including a notice-reading order and union access provisions, which prompted Sysco\u2019s appeal to the Sixth Circuit.","Suffice it to say that the Sixth Circuit declined to enforce the notice-reading order as well. Hopefully other courts will follow suit if the NLRB goes too far again, which it seems determined to do.","Accepting the NLRB\u2019s findings and conclusions, the court agreed with the \u201ctraditional\u201d remedies the Board had ordered, namely a new election, notice posting, and make-whole provisions for two employees who had suffered adverse personnel actions.

That fact allegedly sent a signal to employees that Amazon was involved with running the election, which is more or less laughable.","That open question was answered on January 11, when the NLRB announced that the do-over election would take place beginning on February 4 by mail, and ballots will be counted on March 28 \u201cby way of videoconference and will continue on consecutive business days until completed,\u201d according to the announcement. Interestingly, the announcement did not include a deadline for ballots to be received, so it will be noteworthy if ballots that come in after counting has commenced are included. Because nothing could go wrong with that.","One might think that a lopsided 2:1 outcome rejecting the RWDSU would be enough to convince the union\u2019s top brass that it might be better to seek greener pastures, so to speak, but that would belie the union tradition of refusing to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Instead, union officials groused about their defeat and vowed to keep up their campaign against Amazon, and so they did.","Nevertheless, as the then-acting General Counsel noted about scattershot charges last June, \u201cthere may be dozens that are filed, but it only requires one objection to be upheld to re-run the election.\u201d An NLRB hearing officer last August took heed of that observation and issued a 60-page report recommending that the election be redone based on the RWDSU\u2019s allegations that Amazon had engaged in \u201cobjectionable conduct\u201d because of the mailbox, all while finding little credence in most of the union\u2019s charges otherwise.","Meanwhile, one must wonder what the RWDSU has to offer this time that will convince a majority to vote for union representation.

With the Trump administration underway, the SEIU has begun to realize that it will not have allies working within government to tailor policies to their advantage.","Indeed, under the Obama administration, both the DOL and the NLRB tilted policies heavily in favor of organized labor, and one particular example of that fact is the otherwise obscure \u201cjoint employer\u201d standard.  As this blog has written extensively, this issue has been the cause c\xe9l\xe8bre for a labor movement at its lowest point in 80 years.","This issue crept up about five years ago, when the SEIU created the Fight for $15 and began a series of raucous protests at fast food restaurants.  The objective of these protests ostensibly was a minimum wage of $15 per hour and union representation in the fast food industry, starting with well-known brands like McDonald\u2019s.  The difficulty \u2014 with the latter part at least \u2014 was that organizing individual restaurants had always been difficult and time-consuming for a variety of reasons, not the least of which being that franchisors and franchisees have long been recognized as separate businesses.","The Trump administration\u2019s nominee for Secretary of Labor, Andrew Puzder, will have his confirmation hearing this week, and the union-backed front group Fight for $15 is holding protests today against his nomination.  Their action is just the latest in a barrage of opposition by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and its allies against Mr. Puzder.  However, while he is the object of their ire, behind the scenes what they seem to be most upset about is their impending loss of influence in the Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), both of which have been stacked with union-friendly activists for the last eight years.","Thus, unions like the SEIU urged the NLRB to abolish its traditional joint employer standard in order to facilitate unionization.  The rationale seemed to be that if large corporate franchisors could be made a joint employer, then a successful organizing campaign at a single franchise could force it to the bargaining table.  Once there, the SEIU could then attempt to negotiate national card check and/or neutrality agreements covering all franchisees, which subsequently could be quickly picked off.","On cue, the Obama NLRB rewrote the joint employer standard in its 2015 Browning Ferris decision, and it has appeared poised to apply it in a pending case against McDonald\u2019s.

As highlighted in a 2015 Workforce Freedom Initiative report Theater of the Absurd: The NLRB Takes on the Employer Handbook, the prior NLRB majority undertook a campaign to outlaw previously uncontroversial rules found in employee handbooks and employers\u2019 social media policies. The campaign stemmed from the previous majority\u2019s wildly expansive reading of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, which says that employees have the right to engage in \u201cconcerted activity\u201d for \u201cmutual aid or protection.\u201d","Examples of handbook policies the NLRB has struck down included those requiring employees to act courteously, rules to protect sensitive confidential and proprietary information, and even at-will employment policies. Moreover, Theater of the Absurd pointed out instances in which the NLRB appeared to be at odds with other federal enforcement agencies, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which in some cases requires employers to maintain policies the NLRB declared unlawful.","Yesterday\u2019s ruling overturned the NLRB\u2019s 2004 Lutheran Heritage Village \u2013 Livonia standard for judging employee handbook cases.

By October, the legal case seemed destined to go against the companies when the First District Court of Appeal, Division Four issued a 74-page opinion ordering them to classify drivers using their respective platforms as employees rather than independent contractors.","The passage of Proposition 22 culminates, at least in large part, a legal tug-of-war that has been happening for over two years. It began with the California Supreme Court, which in 2018 unilaterally changed its standard for interpreting whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor. The Court\u2019s decision in a case known as Dynamex rewrote the existing law and adopted a modified \u201cABC\u201d test for evaluating an employment relationship.  The ABC test is known as such because it uses three factors (A,B, and C) to evaluate an independent contractor relationship.  Flunk any one of the three factors and a worker becomes an employee.  Critically, Dynamex  removed an important element of Part B of the test that had facilitated business relationships with independent contractors in other states using an ABC test of their own.","In the days after an election, one can find countless articles analyzing the results of myriad races, and to be sure, this year is no exception. While some aspects of the 2020 election remain unresolved one item of interest in California was settled decisively. By a vote of 58.4% to 41.6%, voters in the Golden State passed a ballot measure\u2014Proposition 22\u2014which was a repudiation of the state legislature\u2019s ill-conceived law known as AB 5.  As readers of this blog know, AB-5 sought to make the use of independent contractors in certain industries nearly impossible.","Meanwhile, the legislature received enough backlash from individuals whose lives it had upended that it later passed legislation to provide dozens of exceptions for certain industries, which one might say is not the hallmark of well-made legislation in the first instance. However, it did no such thing for the gig economy companies that AB 5 had targeted.","For their part, opponents of AB 5 began the effort to pass a ballot initiative to exempt app-based drivers and delivery workers from the law and thereby allow them to remain independent contractors. To be sure, organized labor, which was eager to unionize the thousands of workers who would be forced into employment relationships, campaigned vehemently against Proposition 22 with its usual overheated rhetoric, but in the end voters apparently were not swayed. Given the popularity of things like ridesharing and on-demand delivery, it seems that there are some limits to what the public will, or won\u2019t, support just because labor leaders tell them to.","Not to be outdone, the state legislature, at the urging of organized labor, decided to codify the DynamexABC test in 2019, which it did by passing AB 5. The upshot of the revised test was that it became much harder for someone to be classified legally as an independent contractor, leaving employers either to assume all of the liability associated with an employer-employee relationship or to stop using the services of independent contractors who did not meet AB 5\u2019s stringent test.","Shrinking industries and declining union participation further eroded the contribution base of many plans. Between 1983 and 2016, the number of unionized workers dropped by almost half. Moreover, there has been increased competition facing contributing employers and","their employees. Due to competition and fewer unionized workers, untenable ratios of inactive-to-active participants were created. Many plans now see ratios of one active worker for every two, three, or even five retirees. As expected, industries with high inactive-to-active retiree ratios experience the lowest average funding levels.","Employers are Already Impacted by Partial Withdrawal Liability Assessments. Due to the declining number of union workers, there are businesses that may have only one or two employees left in a business unit. If those employees decide to leave or retire, the employer is assessed with a partial withdrawal liability estimate.

That lack of clarity and certainty puts employersat risk of WHD enforcement and private litigation, and can impede businesses from engagingmany smaller businesses or sole proprietors. For this reason, as well as others identified in ourcomments to the proposed regulation (attached), the Chamber urges the WHD to withdraw thisproposed rescission and allow the Independent Contractor Status under the FLSA regulation totake effect as currently scheduled on May 7, 2021.","The WHD proposes to withdraw the regulation fundamentally because it would \u201cnarrowthe scope of facts and considerations comprising the analysis of whether the worker is anemployee or independent contractor \u201d and that as a result, \u201c as a policy matter, that the Rule\u2019s narrowing of the analysis would result in more workers being classified as independentcontractors not entitled to the FLSA\u2019s protections, contrary to the Act\u2019s purpose of broadlycovering workers as employees. \u201d (86 Fed. Reg. 14034) The Chamber believes this view ismisguided and presumes conclusions that the regulation does not guarantee.","The confusion regarding whether a worker is properly classified as an employeeor an independent contractor has long been a vexing problem for the businesscommunity, across many different industries and work settings. This has led toconsiderable amounts of litigation and other legal actions that the Chamber believeswould be reduced by the clarity and definitive nature of the Proposed Rule.In the Proposed Rule, the Department has provided a contemporary interpretationof the economic realities test that has been long relied upon to determine whether aworker should be classified as an employee or an independent contractor under the FLSA. The Chamber believes the Proposed Rule \u2026 properly focuses on modern,understandable, and meaningful factors. This would benefit workers, consumers,entrepreneurs, independent artists, writers and creators, sole proprietors, businesses of allsizes, and the overall economy.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce enthusiastically supported the final regulationdescribing how to classify a worker as an independent contractor or an employee under the FairLabor Standards Act that was published in the Federal Register on January 7, 2021.

While significant changes in data points can largely be attributed to the recent economic environment, switching from a phone to online approach may have also generated a mode effect.","Businesses have other questions regarding the assumptions the State Department made to fashion its new CoSM. One other important topic companies have raised is whether consular facilities remain closed due to the pandemic. While we appreciate that the State Department offered stakeholders some limited access to review its CoSM data,7 more transparency is needed from the State Department for the business community to determine whether the NPRM\u2019s fee increases are based on legitimate assumptions. As of October 2021, 60% of consulates worldwide remained partially or fully closed to nonemergency nonimmigrant visa appointments, with 40% of all consulates worldwide still remaining fully closed. The NPRM makes no mention of how this state of affairs has influenced the ability of consular officials to timely process the applications listed in the proposal, and whether the reopening of consulates would help boost processing efficiencies.","Noting the dramatic decrease in work volumes during the pandemic, the Department projects that demand for consular service will be depressed for several years into the future. As such, the Department decided to use a 10-year, rather than a 5-year, average of historical and projected workload volumes to calculate unit costs in this CoSM. The Department decided that doing so would minimize volatility in unit costs. Using this longer time frame to assess workload volumes, the Department estimates that demand for consular services is still lower than in prior CoSMs and will remain so for quite some time. \u201cAs a result,\u201d the Department noted, \u201cthe calculated unit cost for these services, which is total service cost divided by total service volume, has increased.\u201d","Last, but certainly not least, the Department makes no mention as to whether its CoSM accounted for the costs associated with the State Department\u2019s adjudications of National Interest Exceptions (\u201cNIEs\u201d) under the several COVID-19 travel restrictions that either were or are still in place today. Businesses fully appreciate the fact that these presidential proclamations created new requirements that increased the number of hours that consular officials needed to expend in adjudicating various types of consular applications. However, the Department provided no explanation in its NPRM as to how these proclamations factored into its formulation for its cost estimates. Presumably, these proclamations will not exist in perpetuity, and employers hope that the State Department made reasonable assumptions as to how such proclamations would impact its cost modeling. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the NPRM to show employers how these presidential proclamations, particularly the increased resources needed to comply with them, influenced how the new CoSM used by the Department helped them arrive at their proposed fee increases. Further transparency would help alleviate any trepidation that employers have regarding the veracity of the Department\u2019s conclusions in establishing its proposed consular fee schedule.","When the first series of COVID-19 entry restrictions were imposed by the Trump Administration, both the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security were provided with the authority to adjudicate NIE requests. However, once these proclamations were implemented in practice, DHS assumed the primary role in adjudicating NIE requests. This lasted through the first few weeks of the Biden Administration, but that changed drastically when the Department of State took over the vast majority of these adjudications as the months passed. Many Chamber members recall these developments vividly, as these changes in policy caused significant disruptions for their businesses. Key executives and critical workers found themselves stuck abroad for inordinate amounts of time as these changes were effectuated and the criteria for obtaining an NIE became much more strict.","The COVID-19 related presidential proclamations that limited the entry of foreign nationals into the U.S. over the past two years have profoundly impacted the global mobility of critical workers to American employers. The consular processing backlogs caused by the pandemic and these pandemic-related entry restrictions will continue to hinder the ability of companies to meet their workforce for some time moving ahead. These policies were instituted in real-time during a national emergency and different administrations went about implementing these National Interest Exception (NIE) procedures in different ways. It remains an open question as to which cabinet level department should have been charged with effectuating the adjudication of these NIE requests.","\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent social and economic crises have shown how entrepreneurs are uniquely equipped to adapt, pivot, and find innovative ways to advance solutions for the greater good,\u201d said Marc DeCourcey, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber Foundation. \u201cWe congratulate all of the Pitch for Purpose finalists, and our winner Symba, for the incredible work they are doing day in day out to serve our communities, and the inspiration they bring to others.\u201d","\u201cOur generation is faced with a confluence of health, economic, social and environmental challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

U.S. exports of goods and services rose over 18.5% in 2021, largely making up for the pandemic-induced 15.6% decrease in 2020. Goods exports increased by 23.3%. International Trade Administration economists note the U.S. set export records with 57 trading partners, including big markets such as Mexico, China, South Korea, and Germany. While this export boom is expected to taper off somewhat, officials will need to be on guard against new trade barriers that could reverse these gains \u2013\xa0as they did in 2019 when new tariffs and foreign retaliation led U.S. exports to decline despite strong economic growth broadly.","Services trade recovering. Services exports increased $60.9 billion to $766.6 billion after dropping $170.7 billion in 2020. Financial and other business services were the top two services export categories in 2021 and grew almost $17.7 billion and $26.8 billion, respectively, after being minimally affected by the pandemic. The strength of these sectors alone demonstrates the competitiveness of the U.S. services sector.","In turn, many global industries scaled up production to meet U.S. demand, to the point that the trade surge overwhelmed some port facilities and generated other supply chain difficulties. However, some sectors, particularly in services, continued to struggle as the pandemic persisted.","U.S.-China trade rolls on\u2026 China remains the top source of U.S. goods imports, increasing by $71.6 billion to reach $506.4 billion in 2021. However, its lead over other markets began to shrink after the U.S. applied tariffs on most Chinese goods, which led to a drop in goods imports from China of $87.9 billion in 2019 and another mostly pandemic-related drop of $17.7 billion in 2020. On the other hand, U.S. exports to China increased 40% from 2019 to 2021. The goods deficit with China increased to $355.3 billion but remains well below the record deficit of $418 billion in 2018.","U.S. energy production continues its boom. Crude oil exports in 2021 reached $69.3 billion, surpassing 2019 as the highest export total of any year. Petroleum exports reached a record $196.1 billion in 2021 after suffering a pandemic-related drop in 2020. After hitting its first surplus in years in 2020 due in part to a pandemic-related drop in energy imports, the energy balance recorded a deficit in 2021. However, this has most likely already shifted back to surplus: In January 2022, \u201cfor the first time ever, U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe exceeded Russia\u2019s pipeline deliveries,\u201d as energy analyst Daniel Yergin recently wrote. The U.S. evolution from being the world\u2019s top energy importer to a significant exporter is having a huge impact on the U.S. balance of trade and global energy markets.","Sure, but the supply chain issues are just temporary because of the pandemic and not a long-term concern, right?","The bill also allows for projects located on tribal lands or sponsored by an Indian Tribe or Native Corporation to have access to FPISC\u2019s permitting process assistance.

However, adopting a post-pandemic approach that prioritizes one group of immigration benefits will eventually harm the processing of all immigration benefits, even those benefits that the department would prioritize.","RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A PATHWAY TO THE NEW NORMAL:Remove the pre-departure testing requirement for all fully vaccinated inbound international arrivals. Because of the pervasiveness of the omicron variant, increased immunity and higher vaccination in the U.S., the pre-departure testing requirement can be eliminated for fully vaccinated individuals without increasing the spread of COVID-19. Removing the pre-departure testing requirement will incentivize vaccination, increase demand for international travel to and from the U.S., and better align passenger aviation entry requirements with those at U.S. land border points of entry and other major travel-trade partners abroad (e.g., the United Kingdom and European Union).","Work with other countries to normalize travel conditions and entry requirements. As the pandemic abates and the Administration works to ease domestic and international travel requirements, it should encourage other nations to do the same and ensure that Americans are afforded the same travel privileges to other nations that their citizens have in the U.S. This should include an effort to align entry protocols with countries representing the top 20 inbound travel markets for the U.S., which include the United Kingdom and several nations in the European Union, as well as a coordinated effort within the State Department to resume routine visa processing in those aforementioned inbound travel markets. This will not only help avoid a confusing patchwork of different vaccination, testing and entry requirements across the globe, but it will also help the U.S. economy achieve the full recovery that it has been searching for since the pandemic\u2019s beginning.","We, the undersigned organizations representing the American travel and tourism business community, are grateful for the Biden Administration\u2019s continued leadership in the fight against COVID-19. With declining hospitalization rates, increased immunity, widely available vaccines and cutting-edge treatments on the horizon, America is reaching an inflection point where endemic-focused policies can replace pandemic-driven restrictions. As leading U.S. travel and business organizations, we respectfully urge the Administration to chart a clear course for replacing pandemic-era travel advisories, requirements and restrictions with endemic-focused policies of a \u201cnew normal\u201d that enable travel to resume fully, freely and safely.","By June 1, develop benchmarks and timelines for a pathway to the new normal that repeals pandemic-focused travel restrictions. As COVID-19 and its variants become no more deadly than many other illnesses which are not closely monitored\u2014or for which there are no travel implications\u2014all remaining restrictions, including international vaccine and testing mandates, as well as any remaining mask mandates, should be removed. We strongly encourage the Administration to chart a path to the new normal and announce a plan to replace pandemic-focused travel restrictions with more permanent travel policies.","For example, we strongly encourage the Biden Administration to immediately repeal the pre-departure testing requirement for vaccinated inbound international air travelers. This would accelerate the return of international travel to and from the U.S. without increasing the spread of COVID-19. For other travel protocols, such as the federal mask mandate for public transportation and the vaccination requirement for inbound international travel, it is time to set clear timetables and metrics for when these pandemic-focused travel requirements can be lifted.","Given travel\u2019s slow economic recovery, and in light of the improved public health metrics in the U.S. and medical advancements to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19, we encourage the Administration to immediately remove travel requirements that no longer fit with the current environment and to set clear timelines and metrics for when others will be lifted.","By March 18, repeal the Federal mask mandate for public transportation or provide a clear roadmap to remove the mask mandate within 90 days. The federal mask mandate for transportation networks is set to expire on March 18. The Administration should use this date as a decision point for either repealing this mandate or announcing a plan and timeline to repeal the federal mask mandate within the subsequent 90 days. Airplanes are already equipped with advanced air filtration systems, and airports have made large investments in air filtration, sanitation and layouts. COVID-19 hospitalization rates have decreased significantly and the mask mandate should be lifted to reflect the improved public health environment.","End \u201cavoid travel\u201d advisories and the use of travel bans. The CDC should ensure that Americans are not dissuaded from traveling to any place with COVID-19 case rates that are equal to, or less than, the case rates prevailing in the U.S. As conditions continue to improve, the CDC should end all \u201cavoid travel\u201d advisories for vaccinated individuals. In the future, the Biden Administration should avoid the use of travel bans from specific countries, which are not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and have proven to be an ineffective means of preventing the spread of COVID-19.","Send a clear message to the American public and the world that it is safe to travel again, particularly for vaccinated individuals. Nations around the world are delivering public messages from high-level government officials and investing in travel promotion campaigns to encourage the resumption of domestic and international travel. Since the start of the pandemic, the federal government\u2019s advisories, policies and public messaging have focused on discouraging or actively restricting domestic and international travel. It is time for high-level officials within the Administration to publicly encourage travel to and within the U.S. Doing so would send a clear message to U.S. businesses, trading partners and travelers alike that America is once again open for business","Throughout the pandemic, many of us have strongly supported federal policies to combat COVID-19 and keep travel moving, including a vaccine requirement to restart international travel and the federal mask mandate.

(2020).","The COVID-19 Vaccine: A Case Study in the Intersection of Basic Research and Private\u200b Sector InnovationThe development of a COVID-19 vaccine provides an instructive example of how basic research ultimately feeds in the creation of new and innovative commercial products and how government, academia, and the private sector can collaborate to address critical challenges.The Pfizer and Moderna COVD-19 vaccines both utilize a fairly novel technology called synthetic messenger RNA or mRNA. Researchers at University of Pennsylvania, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, spent over a decade conducting research on synthetic mRNA and published the findings in 2005. This foundational research inspired founders of Moderna to use mRNA for medicines and raised $2 billion on the concept before going public in 2018. Soon after the world became aware of the COVID-19 virus, Moderna researchers used the mRNA technique to create a vaccine and was one of the first drugmakers to develop a vaccine suitable for clinical trials. Operation Warp Speed, through funding appropriated by the CARES Act, provided Moderna with $2.58 billion in two grants to facilitate development of their vaccine.Likewise, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also utilized mRNA to develop a COVID19 vaccine. BioNTech similarly licensed the novel technology developed at the University of Pennsylvania to try to harness the medical potential of mRNA. At the onset of the pandemic, BioNTech partnered with Pfizer, an 171 year old biopharmaceutical company, to develop and test their mRNA vaccine candidate. While Pfizer did not receive R&D funding through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government agreed to pay $1.95 billion to purchase 100 million doses of the vaccine.Federal support for basic research is not the only public policy whose benefits are highlighted by the new vaccines. Immigrant innovators were often the tip of the spear, and the ability of firms to draw on global production networks sourcing inputs from around the globe has proven essential to the development and deployment\u2014with unprecedented speed\u2014of these novel and impressive vaccines. There are important lessons here for elected officials considering the direction of U.S. immigration, trade, and supply chain policies.Last December, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorizations for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines. The story of both vaccines illustrates how basic federal funding \u2013 for either R&D or the medicines themselves \u2013 paired with private sector expertise can lead to game-changing medical innovations in record time.","Innovation is the key to enabling the United States to emerge from the pandemic, spurring economic recovery, creating jobs, and continuing America\u2019s global leadership. The private sector is leading, and in many cases, is collaborating with academia and the public sector such as on advanced pharmaceuticals like the COVID-19 vaccines. Technologies such as artificial intelligence are helping solve many of the problems we are facing today, like accelerating drug discoveries and enabling our understanding of the virus. Broadband and the Internet are keeping the digital lights on for businesses, enabling children to learn in virtual classrooms, and enabling us get medical care through telehealth. At the same time, Congress will need to undertake an urgent effort to modernize government information technology infrastructure to help us solve problems like vaccine distribution in real-time, advance leadership in key emerging technologies, and bridge the digital divide.

As early vaccine doses to the elderly and those with underlying health conditions were prioritized until there was ample vaccine supply, we would encourage such a prioritization of at-home tests.[3]Curtail Dangerous Reactions to Shortages: Prevent Hoarding","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the \u201cChamber\u201d) is submitting these comments and recommendations in response to the White House announcement on December 2, 2021 and in advance of the issuance of guidance from the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services (the \u201cDepartments\u201d).\xa0 We urge the Departments to consider these concerns and suggestions to best advance the Administration\u2019s stated goals to help Americans access the at-home tests necessary to help stop the spread of COVID-19. These comments have been developed with the input of members of the business community with an interest in improving the health care system.","Over the past two years, businesses have demonstrated agility, tenacity, dedication and resilience in supporting our country and communities.\xa0 In addition to providing resources for employees and their families, businesses have been on the front lines in developing and manufacturing treatments and vaccines, providing health care services to patients, facilitating remote work opportunities, and reflecting concern for the grave impacts of the pandemic. The business community remains committed to the health and safety of our communities and people domestically and abroad.","The Chamber stands ready to work with the Departments and our other public and private partners along with our members to advance policies that will improve the health of our country, our economy and the world.\xa0 We urge you to consider the recommendations detailed here \u2013 many of which have been adopted by other sectors when facing shortages and supply chain challenges as a result of the pandemic.\xa0 We believe adopting these recommendations will help ensure access, deter hoarding, mitigate price gouging and fraud, lessen future premium increases, and facilitate a smooth implementation.","Establish an upper limit on the reimbursement for at-home tests to discourage bad actors from price-gouging consumers and driving up the cost of a limited good. We recommend the Departments cap the reimbursement mandate to no more than $10 per test and ask the Departments to clarify that this does not violate the cash price provisions of The\xa0Families First Coronavirus Response Act\xa0(FFCRA) or The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) because in-home tests are not diagnostic.","If reimbursement is not capped, the price of at-home COVID-19 tests will spike, putting these tests further out of reach for the most vulnerable populations that do not have the benefit of this mandate (which only applies to commercial insurance).","Anecdotally, we offer the Departments the following information from a multi-state health insurer regarding the average monthly costs of COVID-19 provider administered tests for fully insured as well as fully and self-insured plans relative to the plan\u2019s total spending on healthcare, including medical and drug claims, since July 2020. This data only includes the costs associated with the testing alone. There may be additional costs for office visits associated with COVID-19 tests, facility fees, etc. that were incurred and are not reflected in the totals below. This data does not include costs associated with at-home COVID-19 tests.","We also offer data on spending for primary care and emergency room care as a point of comparison. As is delineated below, COVID-19 testing costs are now approaching between a third and a half of spending on primary care provider visits. Similarly, COVID-19 testing costs are now approximately one half of spending for emergency room care and observation.","We are already seeing shortages across the country for at-home test kits.\xa0 While the majority of pharmacies carry them, \u201cmany are showing the kits as sold-out both online and in stores.\u201d As Christmas approaches and the\xa0new omicron variant\xa0surges across the US,\xa0at-home COVID-19 test kits\xa0are in high demand, though high cost and dwindling supplies have left many wanting even before the guidance.\xa0 After the holiday and with Americans returning to work and school in January, shortages for at-home testing will become even more significant.","As we have seen with a variety of products over the course of the pandemic, supply chains are fragile.\xa0 Shortages of medical items are far more dangerous than that of toilet-paper in March of 2020 and cream cheese in December of 2021.\xa0 Just as we experienced in the days following vaccine approval, when pent up demand is coupled with sudden access to a new medical item, shortages, price gouging and hoarding result.\xa0 As our country did in the early days after vaccines were approved, we urge you to consider mitigating these supply chain disruptions by prioritizing recipients until supply is robust.","[1]\u200b President Biden Announces New Actions to Protect Americans Against the Delta and Omicron Variants as We Battle COVID-19 this Winter | The White House[2]\u200b There's a National Shortage of Covid-19 Tests\u2014Here's Where to Find Them Around DC (washingtonian.com)[3]\u200b Why older adults must go to the front of the vaccine line: Study shows speeding up roll-out, prioritizing 60-plus could save 65,000 US lives in three months -- ScienceDaily Costco, ShopRite, Wegmans, Whole Foods, others limit meat purchases to avoid food supply chain problems - nj.com[5]\u200b Grocery store purchase limits are back | Fox Business","Shortages can lead to secondary supply chain assaults such as hoarding, unless limits are put into place.\xa0 As businesses did in the early weeks and months of the pandemic, limits on the amount of ground beef, chicken and even toilet paper protected the hemorrhaging supply chain during shortages. \u201cIn order to prevent the panic buying and stockpiling of goods that occurred at the onset of the pandemic in March, many stores took preventive steps\u2026[t]o ensure all customers have access to what they need.\u201d[5] We recommend a similar approach with regard to at-home tests while shortages persist.","While we support efforts generally to improve access to FDA-approved and/or FDA authorized COVID-19 at-home (or over-the counter/OTC) tests, we urge you to carefully craft guidance to mitigate likely \u2013 and potentially dangerous \u2013 ramifications. Unless certain parameters are included in the forthcoming guidance, implementing a free at-home testing policy will likely exacerbate testing shortages, result in significant hoarding, compound price-gouging and fraud, as well as significantly and unnecessarily increase premiums and destabilize insurance markets. Finally, we urge the Departments to permit flexibility and time in complying with a prospective change.","Amid the optimism, however, increasing concern for inflation is a signal that things are far from normal\u2014and is making for a difficult holiday season for many small businesses.\xa0 This quarter, inflation is among the top cited concerns for small business owners (23%), along with revenue (26%) and COVID-19 safety/compliance (21%).","From April \u2013 July 2020, MetLife and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had switched to producing a special monthly coronavirus report, the\xa0Small Business Coronavirus Impact Poll.

Sixty-one percent of small businesses say the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically disrupted their supply chain, and 55% say worker shortages have done the same. Concern also increased across the board around lack of applicants for job openings, employee retention, and employee well-being/morale.","For the United States to remain competitive internationally and tackle the challenges of future pandemics and jumpstart economic growth, the U.S. must maintain its leadership in technology.  The United States Innovation and Competition Act represents a step toward achieving this goal by supporting research and development in key areas like autonomy, advanced communications, and artificial intelligence.","Intellectual Property Drives Economic Prosperity as World Emerges from Pandemic, New Report Shows","Recent headlines provide the proof. South Africa recently asked both Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer to delay delivery of additional COVID-19 vaccines due to surplus supplies, reportedly the result of an inability to get shots in arms and vaccine hesitancy among their population. Namibia reported plans to destroy hundreds of thousands of expired vaccines due to slow uptake. And India is anticipating using only half of the vaccines they\u2019re producing in December, with healthcare workers struggling to persuade millions of people to return for a second dose. India in particular, but also other countries with superfluous supplies, should be allowing and facilitating more exports including by fulfilling supply contracts to COVAX, the international vaccine program for the poorest countries.","IP laws will help us prepare and respond to future pandemics.","Some governments, including the United States, are talking up a proposal at the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property (IP) laws \u2014 such as patents and trade secrets \u2014 for COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting this would help boost manufacturing and vaccination rates. But this would lead to significant, unintended consequences and is actually more likely to hurt not help pandemic response. Here\u2019s what that policy would actually mean for global public health efforts, now and in the future.","Waiving intellectual property rights for COVID vaccines could have ripple effects on innovators and investments across industries.","The assumption that IP is a barrier to information-sharing is wrong. In fact, an effective IP system encourages companies to trust one another and work together. That\u2019s because IP protection provides the legal foundation to turn competitive companies into collaborators. To date, companies have forged more than 300 contractual manufacturing partnerships to scale up production and distribution of critical COVID-19 technologies, including vaccines. If governments start tampering with IP laws, this injects uncertainty and actually risks unwinding these existing manufacturing partnerships.","As U.S. Chamber President and CEO Suzanne Clark said at a recent event, \u201cCOVID-19 will not be defeated anywhere until it is defeated everywhere.\u201d It\u2019s time for global leaders to rally around meaningful public health policy, not misguided policies like waiving intellectual property. The IP waiver won\u2019t help us end the COVID-19 pandemic. It will exacerbate our challenges even further, and undermine the extraordinary progress that has been made to bring the COVID-19 pandemic to an end.","Without IP-enabled investment in innovation and IP-enabled collaboration to catalyze that innovation, our ability to combat the next pandemic would be severely limited. A pandemic is a whole-of-society challenge that requires a whole-of-society response. From the very first days of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, private sector entities, and universities began forging partnerships to pool the skills and resources needed to deliver emergency relief, including vaccines.","For example, Pfizer and BioNTech partnered with Brazil\u2019s Eurofarma to manufacture doses of their COVID-19 vaccine for Latin America. AstraZeneca partnered with Siam Bioscience in Thailand and Serum Institute of India to manufacture doses of their COVID-19 vaccine, too. Thanks to agreements like these, vaccine manufacturers expect to produce 12.5 billion doses by the end of 2021 and an additional 17 billion doses by July 2022.","Some governments, including the United States, are considering a proposal to waive intellectual property laws for COVID-19 vaccines.","IP enables the investment and discovery of new cures, and waiving it would jeopardize innovation, including new/adapted vaccines to combat COVID-19 variants like Omicron.","The new Omicron variant has laid clear the need for a better global approach on the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations. Right now, nearly half of the world\u2019s population is fully vaccinated. Manufacturers are on track to produce a global surplus of vaccine supplies in 2022, yet \xa0despite almost 40 million vaccinations now being administered daily, only 6.3% of people in the lowest-income countries have received a jab. There\u2019s no debate that we must bridge this divide. But there is debate as to how we do it, and regrettably much of that debate is centered on intellectual property rights.","The available COVID-19 vaccines are the product of decades of investment in research and development \u2014 investment that wouldn\u2019t have been viable without strong IP protections. Strong IP protections provide investors with a chance to make a return on their risky and expensive endeavors, which often fail. In the event that new medical technologies succeed, strong IP laws mean investors\u2019 end product can\u2019t be stolen or misappropriated, at least for a short period of time.","But waiving intellectual property laws could jeopardize medical innovation, including the development of new or adapted vaccines to combat COVID-19 variants like Omicron.","After weathering the worst of the pandemic, up to three million Americans could lose access to their employer-sponsored health coverage if Congress advances flawed policy reforms currently under debate as part of the federal budget reconciliation process.","If we get policy right and we continue to make advances against COVID, going forward the rest of the year, we can expect strong growth. -- almost 8 percent in the third quarter and 5 percent in the fourth. That growth should carry over into 2022 as well.","While some of these are transitory issues caused by the pandemic, there are steps government can and must take to address supply chain issues and the worker shortage. For example:","Healthcare providers and facilities on the front lines of the COVID-19 response.","Businesses that work to follow government guidelines against COVID-19 exposure claims.","Public companies that could face securities lawsuits, including those driven largely on stock price drops resulting from the global pandemic under the spurious assertion that management failed to warn investors.","The undersigned chambers of commerce urge Congress to pass timely, temporary and targeted liability relief legislation to provide businesses a safe harbor from unwarranted lawsuits that, left unchecked, will endanger the fight against the pandemic and undermine the safe and orderly return to work for millions of Americans.","From distillers who switched to producing hand sanitizers, to manufacturers that transformed their operations to construct personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, to front line medical professionals treating the afflicted, to pharmaceutical companies that are expediting research into cures, American businesses have rallied to fight the pandemic. During the stay-at-home orders, essential businesses have remained open and innovated in ways that permitted them to continue to provide critical services and supplies. Now millions of other businesses are in the process of reopening, desiring to do so in a safe manner that protects their employees and customers.","This is an unprecedented situation and despite employers\u2019 best efforts to comply with public health guidance, many are concerned that they will be forced to defend themselves against a wave of lawsuits. Their concern is driven by the fact that each day brings news of more lawsuits that have already been filed. That is why Congress should provide a safe harbor that holds truly bad actors accountable, but that protects those employers who are working to follow public health guidance.  Specifically, temporary protections should remain in place for the duration of the pandemic crisis and response that cover:","To ensure that we continue to wage war against the pandemic while also safely returning Americans to work, Congress must act without delay.","\u201cLike so many other products, the factors driving meat prices higher include increased demand, COVID-related supply chain disruptions, and increased input costs, especially higher energy and labor costs.","\u201cCompetition will enable us to innovate our way through this pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it will help us use all of the challenges, disruptions, and opportunities accelerated by the pandemic to shape a new economic era that will define our future.\u201d","This year, due to the global pandemic, supply chain crisis, and shifting shopping habits, millions of consumers are purchasing their holiday gifts and other necessities online.

This quarter, inflation is among the top cited concerns for small business owners (23%), along with revenue (26%) and COVID-19 safety/compliance (21%).","The current Small Business Index score is 63.0, the highest score since the start of the pandemic. This score is up from last quarter\u2019s score of 56.6 and the nadir of the pandemic in 2020 Q2 when the score reached a record low of 39.","This proposal is fundamentally misguided and should be rejected. It ignores that the overwhelming problem is not vaccine production, it is last-mile delivery, and it will erode the ability of innovative companies to develop the cure\xa0for\xa0the next pandemic or global health threat.","Business is delivering on the promise to manufacture safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the whole world.\xa0 Vaccine production is estimated to reach over 20 billion doses this year, enough for everyone. As of March, over 65% of global population has received at least one dose, and this number is growing every day. Some patients remain hard to reach. Governments and international organizations should avoid political distractions and more quickly achieve comprehensive global vaccination against COVID-19, by focusing on real, practical ongoing issues with last-mile distribution.","If notice and comment is necessary to address the physical presence requirement,we urge the Service to extend Notice 2021-03 through the notice and comment period. Not only will this help plan participants and beneficiaries during the current pandemic, it also will provide options to individuals who may not have easy access to notaries or plan representatives because they live in remote areas, may not be able to take time away from work, may not have easy access to transportation or have physical limitations.","Last fall, the Chamber was part of a group of trades that urged the Service to make permanent the temporary remote witnessing rules for spousal consents or, at a minimum, extend that relief through the end of the pandemic. We appreciate the six-month extension provided in Notice 2021-03 (which expires on June 30, 2021). As part of a group of trades in a letterdate April 19, 2021 and through this letter, we urge the Service to make this the procedures outlined in Notice 2021-03 permanent.","We applaud the work the Service has done to assist participants, beneficiaries and plan sponsors during the pandemic, including Notices 2020-42 and 2021-03. The use of remote witnessing has streamlined plan administration during the pandemic and allowed for individuals to gain access to their accounts who may not otherwise have been able to satisfy the physical presence requirements. Going forward, we believe that remote witnessing should be allowed alongside the physical presence option to help plan administrators in streamlining plan operations and assist participants and beneficiaries who may have difficulty meeting the physical presence requirements, provided the safeguards in Notices 2020-42 and 2021-03 are in place to protect participants and their spouses.","There is never a good time to unnecessarily constrain domestic energy production, but FERC\u2019s recent actions detailing its intended process to analyze natural gas infrastructure certification requests would appear to do just that.\xa0 Not only is FERC doing so at a time when America is facing historic energy prices and inflationary pressures amid its recovery from a pandemic, but geopolitical turmoil overseas now makes it even more imperative that we take advantage of our domestic energy resources, both for the benefit of Americans and the benefit of our allies.\xa0 Halting production and slowing permitting won\u2019t halt demand for the energy we need and the products we depend upon.\xa0 Now is certainly not the time to increase our dependence on foreign resources and impair the ability to access those resources that can be produced domestically.\xa0 Therefore, the Chamber respectfully suggests that it would be appropriate at this time for FERC to revoke its revised policy statements and to reconsider them in light of the clear guidance to FERC under the NGA and NGPA.","While most federal agencies admittedly need funding for technology upgrades and modernization, it is concerning that the reconciliation bill\u2019s $80 billion for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) coincides with plans for increased audits and fines. The IRS should be helping small businesses figure out the dozens of tax changes enacted throughout the pandemic to help Main Street recover instead of pushing its agents to audit more small businesses.","Coming out of the pandemic, small businesses are facing several big challenges including finding workers for their open positions and navigating supply chain disruptions. Several provisions that have been discussed as part of President Biden\u2019s reconciliation spending bill will only create more headaches.","It\u2019s a bad time to punish entrepreneurs. New businesses are opening at their highest rate since the U.S. government began tracking start-ups 17 years ago, and it took business startups more than 10 years to bounce back after the 2007-2009 recession.\xa0 We should be applauding post-pandemic startups, not thwarting their access to capital and growth.","Consumers across the country agree. More than 9 in 10 (93%) shoppers said that supporting small business is more important than ever because of the pandemic, according to a recent QuickBooks survey.","This year, shopping small is easier than ever as many small businesses have bulked up their online presence during the pandemic. Kevin Hubbard, co-founder of Rhoback Activewear in Charlottesville, Virginia, says that with the growth of the digital economy, more and more entrepreneurs are starting businesses online.","For every dollar spent at a small business, American Express estimates an average of $0.67 stays in that business's local community. This has the potential to boost sales during the 2021 holiday season, with many small businesses still working to make up the revenue they\u2019ve lost throughout the pandemic.","Choosing to shop small is choosing to invest in your community. This year, it\u2019s even more meaningful as small businesses face a variety of challenges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Almost half (49%) of the surveyed executives said they are sourcing talent for work that can be done remotely from a broader geographical area than before COVID-19. This is especially true for larger middle market companies ($50 million to $1 billion in annual revenue), with 59% stating they are expanding their talent pool to workers who may not be in the same city, or even the same time zone, as their bosses.","Working toward transitioning from a pandemic to endemic environment, middle market companies are considering the areas in which they want to invest over the next year. For example, 66% of respondents plan to invest in new skills training for their existing employees. At the same time, companies will need to balance the well-being of their employees and clients with the limitations of their office spaces while adhering to federal or state laws.","In the fourth quarter of 2021, more than a third (36%) of middle market companies polled stated they now have employees working remotely who weren\u2019t doing so prior to the onset of the pandemic. Of those, 65% are embracing hybrid work, meaning employees work off-site some of the time and in the office some of the time. Almost half (48%) of the survey respondents have made remote work a permanent option for some employees on a full-time basis, while 42% are considering making that shift","\u201cThe pandemic has been a once-in-a-century event that has significantly altered people\u2019s lives","\u201cThe employment landscape in America has changed dramatically as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we now have a situation where there are too many people without jobs, and there are too many jobs without people to fill them,\u201d said Neil Bradley, Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIn this tight labor market companies that adapt their workforce practices for more flexibility, invest in training and upskilling opportunities, and seek out workers from overlooked talent pools will be better positioned to compete for talent in the post-pandemic economy.\u201d","\u201cToday\u2019s tragic and staggering unemployment figures underscore the dire need for bridge funding to keep more Americans on the job and more businesses afloat during the coronavirus economic crisis,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThere is absolutely no excuse for failing to get these funds approved immediately.

This presents a significant coordination challenge that confuses recipients of broadband funds and leads duplication and otherwise inefficient use of taxpayer funds. Congress has enacted several laws to help address this issue including the ACCESS BROADBAND Act to provide a central website for applicants seeking broadband funding and the Broadband Interagency Coordination Act to ensure coordination between different entities (10).","In addition, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress established broadband programs across the federal government. Several of these include USDA\u2019s Broadband ReConnect Program (established in 2018), as well as other smaller programs in the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Economic Development Administration, the Institute for Library and Museum Services, the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), and other USDA programs (22). Finally, Congressional action to utilize the appropriations process tacitly recognizes that the USF cannot bear the costs of such urgently needed broadband programs.","Third, the clearest support that funding universal service programs through Congressional appropriations is appropriate is that Congress has funded numerous broadband programs through the appropriations process. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted and strengthened several broadband-related programs. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act included $100 million in additional funds for the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (\u201cUSDA\u201d) ReConnect Program, $50 million to support digital services in libraires through the Institute of Museum and Library Services, $200 million for the Commission\u2019s COVID-19 Telehealth Program, and $13 billion for states for educational activities including distance learning (19). In December 2020, Congress enacted the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which included $1 billion for NTIA\u2019s tribal grant program, $300 million for NTIA\u2019s Broadband Infrastructure Program, $285 million for NTIA\u2019s Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program, $3.2 billion for the Emergency Broadband Benefit, and $249 million in additional funds for the COVID-19 Telehealth program (20). Finally, in March 2021, Congress enacted the American Rescue Plan, which included $7 billion for the Emergency Connectivity Fund and $340 billion in general assistance to states, where one of the eligible uses is broadband (21). All of these broadband programs were financed through Congressional appropriations, which indicates the Congress is able, and willing, to prioritize taxpayer dollars to broadband investments.","U.S. Chamber Comments on Expanding Free At-home COVID-19 Testing","\u201cAs we looked across the country and saw what was happening with employment levels, and the inquiries that we were getting from families that were really struggling, we thought we got to do more,\u201d said Nick Green, co-founder and CEO of Thrive Market. \u201cLiterally we saw nine times the typical donate-at-checkout rates that we'd seen before the pandemic.

Drawing on existing partnerships, Thrive Market partnered with organizations championing food access, food banks, and non-profits to make sure healthy essentials continued to get to communities in need through the pandemic.","Continuing to give back during the pandemic was a priority from the start, but the biggest immediate focus for Thrive Market was making sure the employees in the company\u2019s fulfillment centers could stay safe while getting the surge in deliveries out, says Green.","Green announced to the entire company as sales started to surge that Thrive Market would be proactive in social distancing, requiring mask wearing, and doing temperature checks\u2014and that leaders were making it a goal to be the safest place to work in the pandemic.","At the same time, seeing the devastating economic impact that the COVID-19 restrictions were having on communities across the country, the company knew it needed to do more.

Semiconductors are essential to nearly every sector of the economy, including aerospace, automobiles, communications, clean energy, information technology, and medical devices. Unfortunately, demand for semiconductors has outstripped supply, partly due to shifts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. This has created a global chip shortage and resulted in lost growth and jobs, in turn underscoring the need for increased domestic manufacturing capacity.

Such a program would help ensure the health of our communities and reopen the economy.","One of the enduring realities exposed by the pandemic is the fragility of the states\u2019 information technology systems and its cascading effect on state services.\u202fThe danger of these failures is not solely limited to eliminating lines and system crashes. Legacy IT systems present serious cybersecurity risks that ultimately fall to homeland security and law enforcement.\u202fCongress has taken some steps to better the situation for the states with an infusion of American Rescue Plan dollars and a new IT modernization caucus headed by Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va) and Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA). Businesses group such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have also been leading the charge.","States should specifically target funds to meet the digital challenges COVID-19 presented and retire inefficient legacy systems.","States have been granted a truly generational opportunity with massive budget surpluses and an unprecedented infusion of federal funds. States should use this opportunity responsibly to make overdue investments in IT modernization as called for by Congress. States should specifically target funds to meet the digital challenge presented by the pandemic and retire inefficient legacy systems.\u202f Their citizens are counting on them to replace the long lines and frustrating service with efficient systems that deliver results.","The COVID-19 pandemic exposed serious flaws in the states\u2019 ability to meet their citizens\u2019 needs in the distribution of essential services.\u202fAcross the country, Americans faced long unemployment lines, frequently crashing state websites, and widespread fraud as they tried to navigate an unprecedented public health and economic catastrophe. Congress responded to these problems with a huge infusion of funds, and the Department of Treasury allowed these funds to be used to upgrade states\u2019 legacy information technology systems.\u202fThese federal funds, along with state tax revenues, have put the states in a unique position to finally resolve decades-old IT challenges for their citizens.\u202fStates should seize the moment and use these massive surpluses and infusions of federal funds to make critical, long-overdue upgrades to their information technology.","Like almost every American during the pandemic, states have also increased their reliance on technology to meet their daily obligations to their citizens.\u202fThe challenges posed to the states have been well-documented. After the first year of the pandemic and -many reports of massive lines and unprecedented fraud, a U.S. Department of Labor audit found that states \u201cstruggled\u201d to meet their citizens\u2019 unemployment needs. The audit identified antiquated information technology as the primary cause of the problems.","Some states were still using COBOL\u2014a 60-year-old computer programming language\u2014 to confront a novel virus devastating the economy and leaving some states desperately scrambling for graying programmers.\u202f Others, like Vermont, faced overwhelming fraud with 90% of incoming claims suspected fraudulent. Now, almost two years into the pandemic, the state of California has announced that the head of its unemployment division is resigning and that the state will soon welcome its third director in two years.\u202f This turnover comes amid a crushing backlog of unemployment cases and billions of dollars\u2019 worth of fraudulent unemployment and disability claims.\u202f These problems in California\u2019s unemployment division are only buttressed by continued problems with the state\u2019s FISCAL budgeting platform.","Congress responded to the economic effects of the pandemic by providing the states with additional American Rescue Plan (ARP) funding in March 2021.\u202f In total, the states were provided $350 billion dollars by ARP to address pandemic needs and received explicit instructions from the Department of the Treasury that the funds could be used for upgrading state information technology.\u202f This infusion of federal funds, along with surprisingly strong state tax revenues, have combined to produce historic state budget surpluses.\u202f State tax revenues rose 17% in August 2021 compared to August 2020, according to the Urban Institute. Strong revenues combined with unprecedented federal aid meant many states ended their fiscal years with the largest surpluses in their history.\u202f The state surplus numbers are not defined by geography or population, ranging from California ($76 billion) to Illinois ($1.7 billion) to Maryland ($4.6 billion).","\u201cOne thing the pandemic really exposed was how a lack of access to affordable childcare can impact the ability of working parents to simply go to work.\u201d \u2013 Neil Bradley.","Such a one-size-fits-all regulatory approach is simply impossible when talking about adapting safety measures for every workplace in America. This approach will prevent businesses from making the appropriate adaptations necessary to ensure that their workplaces are as safe as possible. A heavy-handed regulatory approach will make it more difficult for safety measures to be quickly adjusted to reflect the changing reality of combatting the coronavirus.","Our members are especially concerned by the push by some to impose new regulatory requirements rather than rely on guidance and best practices. There is no playbook for reopening millions of businesses while simultaneously fighting a pandemic. Yet those in favor of a regulatory approach envision government bureaucrats enforcing a rule book of regulations. For instance, they could issue fines when they find a sneeze guard out of place, an employee using the wrong mask, or two employees five feet ten inches apart, not the mandated six feet.","The Path Forward: Dr. Fauci Urges Americans to Get Their COVID Booster","On behalf of businesses of all sizes and across all industries in the United States that we are privileged to represent as chambers of commerce, we are writing to thank the Administration, the National Governors Association, the United States Conference of Mayors, and the National Council of County Administrators for their efforts to initiate a safe reopening of the economy.

Foremost among these changes is the rise of the remote worker. Employees have proven that they don\u2019t need to come into the office to be productive, and the desire to telecommute has moved from an occasional perk to a worker demand.","How COVID-19 has influenced a fundamental transformation of the working world","Every few decades, a seismic jolt changes the way companies do business, permanently altering the culture of work. Few disruptions, however, have been as tragic and scarring as the COVID-19 pandemic. With millions dead worldwide, national economies hammered and new variants\u2014such as delta and omicron\u2014continuing to emerge, COVID-19 has been more than consequential. It is era-defining.","To face these new challenges, companies have had to be more flexible than ever before\u2014both executives and employees. Carefully and safely reopening the workplace and working toward transitioning from a pandemic to endemic environment has required creativity, perseverance and effective leadership.","A new Privacy Shield will ward off the worst threats of data localization. Absent a deal, however, European regulators are changing facts on the ground, threatening to undermine U.S. economic interests\u2014and transform Europe into a digital island. In 2019, the U.S. exported more than $245 billion in digitally enabled services to Europe, double what it exported to the entire Asia-Pacific region. This trade supports millions of good paying U.S. jobs and is key to U.S. competitiveness in the data-intensive industries of the future. Transatlantic data transfers enable an array of essential activities, including multi-country clinical trials for innovative medicines such as COVID-19 vaccines, cybersecurity threat information sharing, and anti-fraud and anti-money laundering efforts.","First, I would like to note that data is transforming our economy and has been vital in keeping the \u201cdigital lights on\u201d for many companies, particularly small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic whether that be through contact tracing, enabling faster distribution of PPP loans by fintech companies, or helping Americans stay connected through remote work, ecommerce, online learning, and telehealth. Prior to the pandemic, C_TEC released a report which showed that even as the number of data breaches increases, identity theft is holding at around the same levels. This is in part due to data being used to identify fraud and stop it in its tracks.2 We\u2019ve also found that data used by the private sector is helping protect citizens from wildfires, promote financial inclusion, and enhance public safety. Private-sector data enabled law enforcement to locate and stop the San Bernardino mass shooter during his spree.[2]","The Chamber supports the $2.25 billion for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. CISA plays an increasingly critical role in facilitating the development of tools, resources, and best practices to improve the nation\u2019s cybersecurity posture and it has provided critical leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic in helping identify critical workers. The Chamber also supports full funding for the following programs: the Automated Indicator Sharing capability, the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act) program within the Science and Technology Directorate, and the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program.","Travel and tourism are critical to both business and U.S. economic growth.  While COVID-19 continues to impact travel and tourism, the Chamber supports providing resources to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) \u2014including additional staffing, overtime flexibility, technology, \u201cPreCheck\u201d marketing support, and canine teams\u2014to appropriately secure and facilitate the legitimate movement of air travelers.  It is abundantly clear that wait times at airports are dramatically impacting travel and tourism, and Congress should do all it can in working with the TSA to develop effective staffing models and adopt emerging technology for risk-based security strategies to minimize congestion. The Chamber supports $7.6 billion in funding for TSA.","While some federal contracts were paused because of the pandemic, other new ones were created to help support government emergency response initiatives. During the first half of 2020, federal departments such as Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Defense, and Veterans Affairs awarded $17.8 billion in contracts for \u201ccritical goods and services\u201d needed to respond to COVID-19. Of the emergency contracts awarded, $11 billion went toward goods like ventilators, gowns, and N95 respirators, according to the Government Accountability Office.","In September 2021, President Biden announced a sweeping COVID-19 plan with special safety protocols for federal contractors. According to the Executive Order, businesses and workplaces that contract with the federal government are required to provide \u201cadequate COVID-19 safeguards to their workers performing on or in connection with a Federal Government contract.\u201d","We thank the Committee for providing the federal agencies with the resources needed to assist consumers, ensure the integrity of our markets, and support small businesses.

The Chamber appreciates your consideration of these recommendations as you prepare to mark up the Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill.","As the Committee prepares to mark up the Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations bill, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports full funding for the Office of the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and its affiliated programs, and for the Office of State Trade and Export Promotion.  The Chamber and its members support the efforts that agencies have undertaken to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide critical lifelines to businesses. In addition, we urge you to consider the following recommendations.","Lending authority in the amount of $30 billion for the SBA 7(a) lending program. Regulation meant to greatly reduce risk within the banking system has had the unintended consequence of reducing traditional avenues for lending for small business.  As a result, financial institutions have sought other means to mitigate the risk of lending to small businesses. The SBA has been faced with daunting challenges due to administering new programs and loans that congress created to give businesses a lifeline to stay open as we battle the COVID-19 pandemic. Full funding of at least $20 million for State Trade and Export Promotion (STEP) grants under section 1207 of the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240).  These grants have been instrumental in helping states provide aid to assist small businesses export.","Funding for the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF) and IRS funding. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to modernize federal, state, and local government information technology systems. Although we applaud President Biden\u2019s initial call for $9 billion for the TMF, we support the proposed $50 million for the TMF. Additionally, we support increased funding for IRS business system modernization and IRS cybersecurity.","Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors","\u201cFrom surgical masks to single-use cups, plastics played a key role in our lives as we confronted the pandemic,\u201d said Marc DeCourcey, senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. \u201cSustainable management of plastics will be critical to the next phase of COVID-19 recovery, and as we work to create a thriving economy that is good for people and the planet.

Companies that have made remote witnessing available during the pandemic have consistently found that their customers appreciate the additional convenience made possible through remote witnessing options. Moreover, companies incorporating remote witnessing have found that it offers a quick and secure alternative to conventional physical witnessing. According to one company who has adopted remote notarization for spousal consents, the average remote notary session takes less than eight minutes from start to finish.","As of this writing, 31 states have enacted permanent remote notarization rules and additional states are actively considering similar measures. This nationwide trend, which appropriately recognizes the appropriateness and effectiveness of remote online notarizations, has only accelerated because of the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, upsetting all of these rules at this time would create unnecessary chaos. We are not asking the Service to require any state to adoptparticular standards, only that the Service not disregard these state-level standards and permit the use of remote notarization in any case in which a notarization would be recognized as valid under applicable state law.","Commissioner Support for Remote Witnessing.Not only have retirement plan sponsors and service providers recognized the additional security and convenience created by remote witnessing procedures, these benefits have also been acknowledged and supported by the current Commissioner of Internal Revenue. During a March 18, 2021 hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Charles Rettig, expressed his strong support for the permanent extension of the Service\u2019s remote witnessing rules. Specifically, when asked about the use of remote online notarization during the pandemic, Commissioner Rettig said that he was a \u201chuge advocate\u201d for making these rules permanent and expressed his belief that remote notarization is a service that taxpayers \u201cdeserve.\u201d Commissioner Rettig also stated that he was not aware of any issues that would cause the Service to not make its relief permanent.","Remote witnessing has worked well during the pandemic and allowed retirement plan participants to access their benefits without unnecessarily jeopardizing their health by physically meeting with a notary public or plan representative. These personal and public health benefits, however, have not been the only benefits resulting from the use of remote witnessing.","Last fall, through our enclosed letter dated October 1, 2020, the undersigned organizations urged the Service to make permanent its temporary remote witnessing rules for spousal consents or, at a minimum, extend that relief through the end of the pandemic.

Research from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that due to breakdowns in the childcare system, the states surveyed (Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Missouri, and Texas) missed an estimated average of $2.7 billion annually for their economies.","A recent report from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and The Education Trust shows that the pandemic created a vicious cycle for the industry; to return to work, workers need reliable childcare, but providers are facing immense challenges themselves. The pandemic forced many childcare providers to close or scale down: between February and April 2020, the industry lost 370,600 jobs \u2014 95% of which were held by women. Unfortunately, the recovery has not been swift; as late as September 2021, childcare industry employment remained 10 percent lower than pre-pandemic levels.","As of October 2021, the pandemic drove more than 3 million adults into early retirement. In all, the number of adults 55 and older being detached from the labor force due to retirement grew from 48.1% in Q3 of 2019 to 50.3% in Q3 2021.","At the height of the pandemic, more than 120,000 businesses temporarily closed, and more than 30 million U.S. workers were unemployed. Since then, job openings have steadily increased since January 2020, while unemployment has slowly declined.","In addition to the factors outlined below, the survey also revealed some are still concerned about COVID-19 at work, indicate that pay is too low, or are more focused on acquiring new skills and education before re-entering the job market.","Throughout the pandemic, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been at the forefront of efforts to help businesses, families, and industries return to work in a safe and sustainable way. The Chamber has unequivocally supported efforts to make vaccines available and encouraged employees to protect themselves against this pandemic. Yet, private support of vaccination efforts and federal use of regulatory cudgels are two different things.","As part of President Biden\u2019s plan to address the pandemic and increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines, he decreed through an executive order that all federal contracts and subcontracts include a clause directing that all employees working on a federal contract or working at a facility where work on a federal contract is performed be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by a certain date. To support his order, President Biden relies on the Procurement Act, a 1949 law passed to provide the federal government with an \u201ceconomical and efficient system\u201d for purchasing goods and services. But the president points to this language to justify imposing healthcare policies for millions of employees under the threat of ineligibility for future government contracting funds.","America and our economy have faced an unprecedented crisis in the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has caused upheaval and disrupted many standards. Yet despite all the changes, some of which may be with us even after the pandemic has eased, there are bedrock principles that remain and are vital to how our country functions. One of these is that the president can only act based on authority granted to him by Congress, consistent with the Constitution. President Biden\u2019s mandate that employees of federal contractors must receive the COVID-19 vaccine goes beyond that authority.","As the country moves through the pandemic and hopefully settles into a new sense of normalcy, we must never abandon those founding principles that have served us so well:\xa0 The president is limited by Congress in what he can impose on the country, even if the end goal is laudable. And even a pandemic does not \u2013 and cannot \u2013 change that.","American businesses are in the midst of the biggest labor crisis ever, with more open positions than there are available and willing workers to fill them. Business leaders cite the worker shortage as one of the primary obstacles standing in the way of not just their own financial recovery from the pandemic, but also that of the economy writ large. To be sure, instead of workers flooding the market, the labor force participation rate is actually declining.","According to the NLRB, Amazon\u2019s decision to fire the employee was illegal because it violated the NLRA\u2019s protection of concerted activity, as the employee was engaged in protests over Amazon\u2019s COVID-19 policies. Amazon maintains that the employee was terminated because he \u201cpublicly, viciously, and profanely berated a female coworker over a bullhorn and social media broadcasts,\u201d which it called a \u201cvile, offensive, and disparaging verbal attack \u2026 that no employer ever would\u2014or should\u2014tolerate or accept in a civilized workplace.\u201d According to at least one news report about the language used, Amazon\u2019s characterization would seem pretty accurate.","DCMA:  COVID impacts continue to decline; 7 facilities currently impacted; average time to reopen is 18.6 days; same stats from last week so the impact is constant week over week at the moment.","Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors","DPC: P&R memo for vaccines overseas for contractors and dependents directly supporting the DoD has been signed and a copy will be coming our way for distribution to our members.

Question raised regarding COVID related delays in contract awards as some industries have raised concerns this week\u2014OSD response:  \u201cNo we are not seeing such an impact but we will look into the matter more closely.\u201d","Larger small businesses (20-499 employees), in particular, find employee retention a challenge: they rank employee retention (21%) alongside inflation (24%), supply chain disruptions (25%), and COVID-19 (26%) as their highest concerns.","Despite the challenges, the current SBI score is 64.1, the highest score since the start of the pandemic. This score is up from last quarter\u2019s score of 63 and the nadir of the pandemic in 2020 Q2 when the score reached a record low of 39.","Best Disaster Response and Community Resilience Program: General Motors \xa0As the COVID-19 pandemic worsened, GM recognized its unique supply chain relationships and harnessed its ability to quickly scale manufacturing. The company partnered with Ventec Life Systems to build more than 30,000 ventilators at its manufacturing facility; additionally, more than 5,000 employees volunteered to make and distribute more than 7 million masks across the country.","Best Economic Opportunity and Empowerment Program: Entergy Corp.\xa0Ensuring that\u202fstruggling\u202fcustomers receive\u202fbill payment\u202fassistance from the\u202fLow Income\u202fHome Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)\u202fis a\u202flong-standing\u202fcomponent of Entergy\u2019s poverty-relief efforts that gained momentum during the pandemic.\u202fEntergy helped more than 250,000 bills get paid with $65.4 million in assistance, exceeding the goal by almost $20 million and increasing bill\u202fpayments\u202fby 26 percent over 2019.","\u2014 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation announced the recipients of its 22nd Annual Citizens Awards \u2013 eight purpose-driven companies that have demonstrated steadfast leadership in creating opportunity and building more resilient communities as America continues its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. From creating the world\u2019s largest STEM program, to meeting critical sustainability targets, to donating life-changing supplies to vulnerable populations around the world, this year\u2019s winners showcase how the private sector is accelerating momentum for a more equitable and sustainable future.","Second, stopping COVID-19 is a global emergency, and attention should focus on addressing the pandemic first. Officials should not impose measures that will complicate immediate efforts to secure supplies of goods that are saving lives.","The Biden administration and Congress should work with the private sector to enhance supply chain resiliency and mitigate risks made evident by the pandemic. To achieve these goals, the first imperative is to get the facts straight.","To this end, the U.S. Chamber supported the measure in the CARES Act calling for the National Academies to issue a report on the security of the U.S. medical product supply chain to inform policymakers as they examine these issue. A misdiagnosis of these challenges could undermine U.S. pandemic response, disrupting both domestic and global supply chains and spurring foreign retaliation against job-sustaining exports.","Third, officials should recognize that supply chain challenges do not lend themselves to a one-size-fits-all solution. For some products, stockpiling is key. For personal protective equipment (PPE), for example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused demand to rise 40-fold, causing widespread shortages. There is no question that these alarming shortages arose from this dramatic surge in demand and not from the particular geography of their supply chains. Indeed, pandemic preparedness experts have warned for years that governments should establish robust strategic stockpiles, and doing so should be a key goal for select products.","For other products, geographic diversity of supply is vital. The vast majority of pharmaceutical products have not suffered shortages during the pandemic, and in the United States, officials indicate that fewer than two dozen of the 20,000 FDA-approved products on the market are dependent on a single foreign source. Upholding diversity of supply from a wide range of geographic sources is a proven risk-mitigating tool that contributes to resilience, and officials should focus on ways to enhance it and to limit vulnerabilities where they exist.","The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the critical nature of U.S. supply chains for a range of products, including some that are produced almost entirely domestically (e.g., meat) and some that are mostly imported (e.g., antipyretics). Dozens of bills as well as executive branch actions propose to address these vulnerabilities.","As a salute to its storied past, Egypt recently staged the Pharaohs' Golden Parade\u2014a livestreamed procession of 22 mummified kings and queens from the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square to the recently opened National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. The grandiose event featuring Egypt\u2019s ancient royalty was an opportunity to showcase the country\u2019s exceptional history and appeal as a tourist destination with an eye to reinvigorating interest from travelers emerging from constraints imposed by COVID-19.","Egypt\u2019s digital economy has seen accelerated adoption of technologies and magnitudes of growth during the pandemic. This was even true pre-pandemic as the ICT sector\u2019s contribution to Egypt\u2019s GDP had steadily been increasing. And while we\u2019ve had valuable engagement on data privacy regulations and other related areas, there is going to be so much more work ahead of us to ensure alignment and to take full advantage of the innovations and technologies of today and tomorrow.","The first section of this white paper authored by the PERC addresses how technology and data have been used to aid in the fight against and recovery from COVID-19. Later sections are policy proposals put forward by C_TEC for a national data strategy.","Data has long been a driver of the United States\u2019 21st century economic leadership in analytics in the areas of financial inclusion, public health, and safety. The coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has further brought to light just how important the use of data is to mitigating the effects of the virus, tracking and slowing its spread, and promoting economic recovery. In order for Americans to continue to reap these vital benefits, the Chamber Technology Engagement Center (\u201cC_TEC\u201d) calls for a national data strategy, including the need for national privacy legislation, a robust artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) framework, and information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) modernization for federal, state, and local governments.","In terms of broadband adoption, Congress needs to provide funding to address students who are unable to connect during COVID-19 and look at ways of improving Lifeline.","With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) earlier this year, $350 billion in financial aid was extended to all 50 states at the statewide, county, and metropolitan level. This aid was offered with the intention that it would be used flexibly to enable states and localities to use those funds to best help their economies to recover from the economic downturn brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, this aid was offered with a catch. A provision of the American Rescue Plan stipulates that these funds may not be used by states \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d to offset revenue reductions. (section 9901, P.L. 117-2)\u200b.","- Today, Senior Vice President of the U.S. Chamber Global Innovation Policy Center Patrick Kilbride issued the following statement in response to the release of the Special 301 Report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). The annual report reviews the global state of intellectual property (IP) rights protection and enforcement.\u201cInnovations enabled by IP are delivering us from the current pandemic, and can defend us against the next one \u2013 if predictable, reliable, and enforceable intellectual property rights remain available world-wide to secure the underlying investments. USTR\u2019s work to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the global IP infrastructure is critical to a healthy innovation ecosystem. With the Special 301 Report as a blueprint, we can enhance the legal and economic environment to support the vaccine researchers, movie and music producers, scientific journal publishers, software and telecommunications engineers, and countless others whose cutting-edge products have supported us throughout this crisis.\u201cThis year, in its filing, the U.S. Chamber identified systemic and market-specific IP issues in global markets like: Brazil, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Vietnam, Turkey, Korea, China, and Mexico (among others). We focused on harmful policy realities like: insufficient patent protection; compulsory licensing; inadequate responses to counterfeiting and piracy; forced screen and broadcast quotas; localization requirements; regulatory approval delays; unfair competition law proceedings and extraterritorial remedies; data transfer restrictions; and general market access barriers.\u201cToday, we reiterate our concern that the mistaken belief that IP rights can be a barrier to access for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has induced some countries, U.N agencies and special interest groups to seek to undermine those rights. Let me be clear: IP rights help \u2013 they don\u2019t hinder \u2013 access to innovation by enabling long-term investments in technology in the first instance, and by supporting a wide range of public and private partnerships to appropriately share know-how and capabilities through IP licensing.  The U.S. Chamber International IP Index shows that countries with strong IP systems have significantly higher innovation production, invention rates, and knowledge output \u2013 as well as greater access to innovation.\u201cWe thank USTR and the U.S. government as a whole for their consideration of our filing and, more importantly, we commend them for their efforts to promote and protect American intellectual property at home and around the world.\u201d","America\u2019s communications networks play an essential role in connecting Americans and are revolutionizing the way that people work, learn, seek medical care, and communicate with friends and family. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the private sector has played a critical role in keeping the \u201cdigital lights\u201d on for the economy. The Chamber believes that broadband adoption, access, and affordability serve as crucial building blocks to connect all Americans and enable the internet economy to flourish.","That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t still supply challenges in the childcare industry.\xa0Even before the\xa0pandemic, there were a dwindling number of providers, with 35% of small in-home providers closing their doors between 2011 and 2017. Like many other sectors, the childcare industry is facing a worker shortage.","That said, the pandemic has given us a historic opportunity to make a meaningful investment in a generation of at-risk children and their parents. States should be given the flexibility to do that.","For example, states have broad flexibility for how to use the $15 billion portion of pandemic-relief for state-based childcare block grants (CCDBG), a long-running program where states provide vouchers to low-income working parents to go to a childcare provider of their choice. In essence, a school choice program for early childhood care.","Provider-specific support made the most sense in the height of the pandemic last year, when\xa070%\xa0of parents reported that their childcare programs were closed or operating at reduced capacity, according to a\xa0Bipartisan Policy Center\xa0poll.\u202fBut the vast majority of\xa0childcare\xa0providers have now reopened.\xa0 As of June 2021,\xa0only one in ten parents\xa0reported their provider was still closed, while a much larger percentage cited affordability as a key challenge, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.","However, the $24 billion earmarked for childcare stabilization funds is only allowed to go to providers (for wages, rent payments, facilities, or pandemic-specific safety measures, among other uses).","While the CCDBG successfully targets needy households with emphasis on choice, the program has only served 20% of eligible children due to chronic underfunding. The pandemic emergency funding could change this and significantly help more eligible families get access to high-quality childcare.","Pandemic-Induced Childcare Challenges Could Forever Change the Workforce","The pandemic caused a major disruption in America\u2019s labor force\u2014something many have referred to as The Great Resignation. In 2021, more than 47 million workers quit their jobs, many of whom were in search of an improved work-life balance and flexibility, increased compensation, and a strong company culture.","During the pandemic reshuffling, jobs that require in-person attendance and traditionally have lower wages, have had a more difficult time retaining workers. For example, the leisure and hospitality and retail industries have had the highest quit rates since November 2020, consistently above 4.5 percent.","The manufacturing industry faced a major setback after losing roughly 1.4 million jobs at the onset of the pandemic. Since then, the industry has struggled to hire entry level and skilled workers alike.","U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President of Immigration Policy Jon Baselice released the following statement today on the amended DHS regulations to allow non-essential travelers who have been fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and have appropriate paperwork to enter the U.S.:","Some governments and media are distracted from practical solutions to achieving global vaccinations with issues unrelated to getting shots into arms. For example, they claim, without evidence, that weakening or suspending intellectual property rights for vaccine producers would somehow hasten the production and delivery of doses. On the contrary, the discovery of COVID-19 vaccines in record time was the product of decades of research and investment, strong private-public partnerships, and licensing technology\u2014all of which\u202frequire clear and enforceable rules for intellectual property.","The Biden Administration\u2019s recently\u202fannounced plan\u202fis on the right track, and industry and Congress should continue to support such efforts. Making these investments now will save trillions later, by hastening the end of the pandemic and the impending risk of new COVID variants.","The U.S. can provide support for public education to fight vaccine hesitancy, aid in training healthcare workers, increase the cold chain capacity, and bolster medical supplies. Additionally, the U.S. Government could consider appointing a senior official in the White House to organize and oversee international efforts to combat COVID-19.","Business is delivering on the promise to manufacture safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the whole world.","Related Content          4 Things to Know About Intellectual Property and COVID-19 Vaccines","Finally, now that attention is turning to preparations for the next pandemic, some argue that greater regional vaccine production should be established, especially in Africa. Continental partnerships announced by Moderna and BioNTech, and\u202fJohnson & Johnsons\u2019 partnerships with Aspen,\u202fare significant developments in this regard. To be effective, such efforts must be sustainable and capable of addressing the next challenge, not just the last one. Private\u202finvestment is the key, and putting in place the legal and economic conditions to support such investment will be essential in the long term.","2021 was a historic year for vaccine production, and the momentum continues. Last year saw the production of 10 billion does of COVID-19 vaccines, and production in 2022 should exceed 20 billion. These milestones lead Deputy Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Anabel Gonzalez, to note how \u201cnever has the world seen such a rapid development of a viable vaccine.\u201d","In all of the above, continuing partnerships between governments and businesses will be necessary to overcome this pandemic and prepare effectively for the next. Focusing on real and practical challenges and solutions is the only responsible path ahead.","The U.S. has a long and proud tradition of leading the global response to global health challenges. The business community supports a greater global leadership role for America to bring the pandemic to an end. This requires focusing on real, practical matters.","The U.S. Chamber and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have also launched a work stream to leverage the technical expertise of the private sector in both countries to continue to tackle the pandemic, close the gap in vaccination, support diagnostics, and support institutional preparedness for the future. We remain critical partners in this fight and are #InThisTogether!","This rang especially true throughout the pandemic when Bangladesh shipped over 6 million pieces of personal protective equipment to the U.S. during the first devastating surge of COVID-19. As we configure a steady post-pandemic recovery and increasingly make progress on the global COVID-19 vaccination drive, to date, over 16% of Bangladeshi people have been vaccinated by the 61 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines that the U.S. has donated to Bangladesh through COVAX - the largest donation from the U.S. to any country. The U.S.-Bangladesh Business Council and a coalition of industry leaders, in partnership with Project C.U.R.E., joined this fight by sending shipments of oxygen concentrators, PPE, emergency relief beds and other critical life-saving medical equipment to Bangladesh for medical colleges in the country last year.","The elephant in the room was the coronavirus and how it affects aviation, travel, and the economy. The Chamber\u2019s advice is to be prudent and prepared, but not to overreact. Americans should listen to medical experts and government officials but feel confident going about their daily lives, including traveling.","And we are all acutely aware in this moment that we need a global plan not only to get us through this pandemic but also to prepare us for the next one.","Pandemic-era disruptions have accelerated the pace at which technologies like automation and artificial intelligence can be applied to work. Through the leadership of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s soon-to-be-announced AI Commission and our broad tech advocacy, we will make sure government policy is supporting innovation\u2014not holding it back.","When international governments begin negotiating a global pandemic treaty\u2014as the World Health Organization has pledged to do\u2014the private sector must have a seat at that table.","When small business owners across the country reported the highest levels of optimism since the start of the pandemic, we wondered why. After all, they\u2019re facing the challenges of a 40-year inflation high, a historic worker shortage, and supply chain disruptions\u2014not to mention more COVID uncertainty.","Competition will enable us to innovate our way through this pandemic. And it will help us use all of the challenges, disruptions, and opportunities accelerated by the pandemic to shape a new economic era that will define our future.","We all know that the competition for talent has become an urgent and complex economic imperative. What the data tells us\u2014and what you deal with every day\u2014is that nearly 11 million jobs sit vacant. More than 2 million people lost their jobs or left the workforce during the pandemic\u2014and half of them still aren\u2019t actively looking for work.","This dynamism isn\u2019t simply a feature of the COVID economy, nor is it just limited to startups and entrepreneurs. In fact, if you look at the top 10 companies by market cap, you\u2019ll see that not one of the companies on the list in 1980 is still on that list today. And if you look at the list over time, you see companies move in, out, back in, and so on.","We all witnessed the stunning capacity for innovation in the race for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Who won? Humanity...with multiple vaccines and drugs made widely available, saving millions of lives and providing millions of people our best defense yet against the pandemic. And the race to distribute them worldwide must continue with urgency.","In the wake of the current pandemic, Congressional support for the RT program is more important than ever before. The Registered Traveler Act of 2020 can help airports streamline the traveler experience through touchless technology that minimizes lines and crowding. This is especially important in a post-COVID world where social distancing and screening will likely be the new \u201cnormal\u201d for many air travelers. Additionally, the Act would: (1) solidify the authorization for public-private RT partnerships that advance innovation at airport security checkpoints; (2) define TSA\u2019s role in approving and supervising RT programs; and (3) grant RT providers access to technology, information, and procedures to improve security and traveler experience through streamlined identity verification, vetting status authentication, and routing to physical screening at airport security checkpoints.","Prior to the current pandemic, ever-rising volumes of air travelers placed increasing strain on airlines, airports, and security regulators. We fully expect these numbers will return and that TSA will continue to rely on successful public-private partnerships to minimize touch points and crowds, because registered travel providers are positioned to continue to provide touchless experiences at the airport, helping to create a faster and more efficient experience for all travelers.","\u201cThis is a pivotal time for our country, our economy, and for generations of Americans. We not only face the tremendous burden of overcoming a pandemic and recession, but also a historic moment to unleash a new era of inclusive growth, widespread opportunity, and boundless innovation.\u201d","\u201cJob number one must be pandemic relief.  American small businesses cannot afford for Congress to wait another three months to act. We stand ready to help our leaders get this much-needed legislation passed as quickly as possible.","This second wave of paid advertising will air in districts represented by Deborah Ross (D-NC-02), Kathy Manning (D-NC-06), Tom Malinowski (D-NJ-07), Angie Craig (D-MN-02), and Antonio Delgado (D-NY-19). The ads appeal to voters who understand the perils of raising taxes as the nation seeks to recover from the pandemic and calls on them to contact their members of Congress to voice their opposition. The ads, which can be viewed here, target key Congressional districts and future rounds may include more districts.","C_TEC encourages Congress to provide technology-neutral, non-duplicative targeted funding and permitting relief to ensure that unserved Americans have access to the Internet. Broadband access is a bipartisan issue and will be vital to ensuring millions of Americans are not left behind in this new digital economy, an issue rendered even more pressing by COVID-19. The Chamber stands ready to work with you.","Unfortunately, many Americans do not have access to high-speed Internet, particularly in rural America. A C_TEC report from last year highlighted that adoption of digital tools by rural small businesses (many of which are struggling during the pandemic) would increase annual U.S. GDP by approximately $41 billion, and would create 316,605 jobs. Broadband will be crucial to economic recovery, especially for small businesses.","Chairman Pai\u2019s leadership has enabled the nation\u2019s communications infrastructure to weather the challenges posed by the pandemic. He led a voluntary effort by broadband providers to continue service to customers experiencing economic hardship.

According to September employment data released by the U.S. Labor Department, despite a reduction in total unemployment from 5.2% to 4.8%, Black unemployment remained at 7.9% while Hispanic unemployment fared only slightly better at 6.3%. White unemployment for the same period dropped to 4.2%.","It\u2019s a mindset shift born out of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on Black workers. When the pandemic hit the United States in March 2020, the virus\u2019s impact on employment exacerbated long-standing trends in racial disparities in the labor market. Black men and women were hardest hit by mass layoffs. Coupled with the racial wealth gap, Black male and female workers and their families were particularly vulnerable to the worst economic effects of the pandemic.","At the height of the pandemic, for instance, unemployment among Black Americans soared to 16%. For comparison, just a year earlier in 2019, Black unemployment had fallen to a historic low of just 5%.","\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be more holistic in the private sector and policy space if we are truly going to create the kind of environment in which Black women can thrive,\u201d says OneTen\u2019s Jones. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the pandemic in 2020 has hopefully helped us to relearn and revisit that we still have work to do in these spaces.\u201d","While employment levels among Black Americans have recovered from the depths of the pandemic, they still trail those of other ethnic groups.","As damaging as the impact of the pandemic has been on Black employment overall, it has been particularly devastating on Black women. Black women lost the most jobs during the pandemic and have thus far recovered the fewest jobs. There are an estimated 550,000 fewer Black women working today than before the pandemic. Among unemployed women ages 16 and over, 41% of Black women have been without work for over six months.","Historically, Black unemployment has never moved in parity with that of white Americans. But, in a post-pandemic environment with a tight labor market, persistent disparities in employment rates call for innovative solutions to the problem.

The proposed tax increases, including a new corporate minimum tax on book income, a new tax on stock buybacks, and tax increases on U.S. business income earned abroad, will harm the recovery and hamstring America as we work to compete globally, especially with China. The pharmaceutical price controls could result in fewer drugs being introduced to the U.S. market in the coming decades.\u202f America may miss out on the next vaccine or treatment for the next pandemic because of these short-sighted policies.\u202f Anti-energy provisions in the bill would increase the cost of energy for all Americans and could lead to energy supply shortages and power outages while prices are already the highest in a decade, squander domestic energy security, and threaten the supply chain for clean energy technologies.

Finally, because of various budget gimmicks, including sunsetting new programs, in some cases after only one year, the true cost of the proposed bill is significantly higher than the nearly $2 trillion that is advertised.","As we recover from the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses across the nation face significant headwinds, including a worker shortage crisis, massive supply chain disruptions, and the highest inflation in more than a generation. We need Congress focused on helping address these problems. Unfortunately, the so-called \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d reconciliation bill that is currently under consideration would add to rather than reduce the challenges confronting America\u2019s employers.","Beyond the energy sector, U.S. businesses also face USMCA compliance and implementation challenges in Mexico in areas such as trade facilitation, digital trade, and biopharmaceutical procurement. From our perspective, these issues are creating greater investment uncertainty at a moment of historic opportunity for Mexico\u2014an opportunity that would be undermined by misguided policies. U.S. companies want nothing more than to enhance investments in Mexico to support a robust recovery from the pandemic, but the lack of legal security and transparency is making it difficult.","From an ongoing pandemic to war in eastern Europe, the global economy is both growing briskly and facing sudden headwinds, making it all the more important for economic partners to work together to invest and grow. For American companies, there are few partners as vital as Mexico, our country\u2019s top trade partner. As I travel here this week to meet with government and business leaders, my priority is to strengthen our partnership for the benefit of both nations.","Although some critics often point to the potential negative impact of automation on drivers, automated vehicles would actually help with the national trucker driver shortage and complement the existing trucking workforce. For years, the U.S. has faced a chronic shortage of truck drivers, an issue exacerbated to crisis levels around the globe due to pandemic disruptions to supply chains and surging demands for delivery services. The result has been far-reaching. Fuel shortages, stalled manufacturing, and record prices for supplies are just some of the problems plaguing companies across industries. The deployment of self-driving trucks would help fulfill these critical needs and build resilience to global supply chains, especially as the shortfall of drivers is projected to more than double by 2028.","The U.S. Chamber Foundation\u2019s Corporate Citizenship Center is interviewing business leaders driving the global corporate response to COVID-19 to learn more about their efforts, how they are navigating this uncharted territory, and what advice they have for others.","Q: PepsiCo and The PepsiCo Foundation launched an initiative to provide more aid to communities of color across the country. What are the some of the unique challenges communities of color are facing as a result of COVID-19 and how can the private sector help?","We've had a lot of great, long standing partners at PepsiCo, including the National Urban League and UnidosUS \u2014 which are not only well-known organizations that do great work, but they also have affiliate organizations across the country that we can tap into and leverage locally. In May, we announced a $7 million investment with these organizations that would support COVID-19 relief and programming for longer-term economic growth at both the national and local levels.","As soon as we started to recognize there was a clear disparity in rates of infection and deaths from COVID-19 among African American and Latino populations across the country, we decided to focus on what we could do to provide immediate relief. We focused on providing support for testing and screening, providing PPE, supporting front line workers and things of that nature. There\u2019s a range of challenges facing communities of color. It's access to opportunity, access to health care, access to food, and access to information. We wanted to make sure that we were working to address the longer-term economic impact of the pandemic on these communities, too.","As the coronavirus continues to bring a great deal of uncertainty to our world, one thing is clear: the business community is on the frontlines of the fight against the pandemic, demonstrating unparalleled agility and innovation to help our country navigate this health and economic crisis as fast and effectively as possible.","Hurricanes or earthquakes usually affect only one specific region of the country. But this pandemic has impacted everyone and is somewhat unprecedented. This is new territory for so many businesses and so many people.","Read on to hear what Kenny Thompson, Head of External Affairs, North America at PepsiCo, shared with the U.S. Chamber Foundation in July on how PepsiCo leaned on partnerships to support communities in need. What follows has been edited and condensed for clarity.Q: Can you tell us about your efforts at PepsiCo to address the impacts of COVID-19?","PepsiCo has always been focused on supporting communities around the country. So, we haven\u2019t shifted our thought process, but we have narrowed our focus to see what needs exist and what we can accomplish locally. The relationships we\u2019ve effectively leveraged during this pandemic are relationships that we established years, and in some cases, decades ago. The organizations we have consistently worked with are the same ones guiding our relief efforts today.","Q: How is the coronavirus pandemic different than other disasters or crises you\u2019ve responded to? Do you have any lessons learned or best practices you\u2019d like to share with the larger business community as they navigate their response?","Q: Over the course of this crisis, we\u2019ve seen unprecedented agility and ingenuity from the business community, as they\u2019ve rearranged operations or shifted production overnight to lead the fight against this pandemic. What do you think this crisis has shown about the role of business in society?","Although America\u2019s broadband providers have led the world in managing capacity changes during the pandemic, at least 18 million Americans lack access to broadband, with lower-income students and students of color being disproportionately affected. For example, nearly 18 percent of Latino and 11 percent of Black American households lack computer access. With the majority of students returning to school online, it is fundamentally unfair to allow students who lack the digital tools to connect to fall through the cracks of the Digital Divide and in danger of being left further behind. Connectivity is an imperative of the Chamber\u2019s Equality of Opportunity initiative.","According to data provided by Burning Glass Technologies over the past year, property managers have been most in demand, while the highest growth in job openings has been for maintenance talent. Property managers have proven critical to rental housing operations throughout the pandemic and account for the industry\u2019s highest percentage of job openings. In contrast, leasing positions have fallen in demand and represent the lowest percentage of job openings for onsite property management positions, largely due to the industry\u2019s shift to virtual leasing platforms. As the apartment industry continues to recover, more in-unit maintenance activities will resume, and it is expected that job growth will continue to rise in the maintenance career pathway. However, recruiting qualified maintenance professionals is challenging due to a lack of industry awareness, competition with higher-paying construction-related jobs, and difficulty reaching the desired audience through advertising. To help combat this, employers have partnered with training providers and community-based organizations to develop unique technical training programs to prepare new and untapped pipelines of talent for work.","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the recruiting and hiring timeline has experienced considerable impacts. The national time to fill apartment jobs increased from 45.9 days in 2019 to 48.4 days in 2020. Employers likely struggled to fill vacancies quickly because job seekers were more cautious about which jobs to apply for due to safety concerns. In addition, government financial assistance, and concerns related to school closings and childcare, may have also impacted job searches and, therefore, time to fill vacant positions.","Key Stat: The number one statistic that will drive our workforce needs is related to the reopening of domestic and international travel. Domestic travel will rebound first, but the return of international traffic is less predictable due to uneven COVID vaccine policies and availability in various market countries.","Additionally, due to the lifestyle of many drivers being on the road for several days, sometimes weeks, before getting home, it has been difficult to get enough drivers during a pandemic. This has always put the trucking industry at a competitive disadvantage with other industries, despite good wages and benefits for truck drivers. We also hear from motor carriers that office staff has quit once the latest round of stimulus checks hit bank accounts.","The U.S. dairy processing industry, like many other industries, is facing a severe labor shortage. Our members struggle to find people with the skills and willingness to fill jobs in their plants and ancillary roles (e.g., commercial truck drivers). Reasons employers cite for this issue include limited access to employment visas for highly technical positions, generous unemployment benefit payments, and lack of child care due to the COVID pandemic.","With over 200 different career paths, endless possibilities exist for associates to create lifelong careers in the hotel industry. The industry also offers associates competitive pay, generous benefits, and the ability to be promoted or transfer skills to any hotel across the globe. Yet, in a recent AHLA member survey, 96% of respondents report having open positions that they cannot fill at their hotels despite actively seeking staff. Additionally, 61% of survey respondents have less than half of their pre-COVID staff working today.","We have always had a difficult time getting qualified truck drivers in our industry. However, it has become more difficult over the last year. For example, truck driver training schools trained far fewer new drivers last year due to the pandemic. This means that demand for drivers is outpacing supply even more than normal. And even if schools can increase capacity soon, it will take time to train enough drivers to overcome the current deficit.","The pandemic has been devastating to the hospitality industry workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, leisure and hospitality have lost 3.1 million jobs during the pandemic that have yet to return, representing more than a third of all unemployed persons in the United States. Even starker, the unemployment rate in the accommodation sector remains 330% higher than the rest of the economy. Unfortunately, the road to recovery for the hotel industry is long. As hotels across the industry begin to ramp up hiring to accommodate an increase in leisure travel this summer as more people are vaccinated, hotels in major markets across the country are struggling to rehire or hire associates.","Recruiting from U.S. territories where workers are idle due to hurricanes and COVID.","The pandemic has exacerbated the shortage of workers for the manufacturing sector. PLASTICS\u2019 current forecast of job growth this year is dismal, starting with a 0.6% increase in plastic materials and resin production employment and a 0.2% increase in plastics machinery manufacturing. A 2.4% increase in plastics product manufacturing employment is projected and a 3.7% increase in molds for plastics employment this year. Whether or not job openings are filled remains primarily a function of supply. The gradual reopening of the economy thus far has been matched with slow hiring in the plastics industry. The lack of workers is one explanation of the supply chain shortages the economy is currently experiencing.","The most in-demand roles right now are in I.T. and Cyber. Challenges we face with the I.T. market are requests for remote work and the level of experience/skill set needed to fill these roles. Operating in a post-Covid environment, we see many more people asking for remote working arrangements that are hard to accommodate in our industries. We find it challenging to fill unskilled worker categories and plant operators since many folks receive enhanced unemployment benefits compared to regular pay levels. Niche and experienced engineering roles are always challenging (Controls, Instrument), and some are unwilling to work without flexible work arrangements. We see demand in skilled crafts increasing for Pipefitting, Electrical, Welding, Mobile Crane/Rigging, Carpentry, and Instrumentation \u2013 with E&I technicians being one of the most challenging positions to fill.","It can be challenging for us to find legal counsel in the regulatory affairs and compliance areas, as we compete with some private employers and firms that may pay more. The fact that we could hire remotely during the pandemic opened up some candidates for counsel roles that we previously might not have considered and has helped us to hire well. The consideration of remote work may be both a benefit and a challenge to our future retention and hiring, however \u2013 as we look at fully opening our office again and asking staff to come back in, the continued interest in full-time remote work may result in some incumbents saying \u201cno\u201d to returning to the office environment and/or candidates turning down a position that may require them to come into the office.","Key Stat: 10% - That was our turnover percentage in 2020, which was about half of the local manufacturing turnover rate. Fortunately, we didn\u2019t have to lay off any employees through COVID. Fast forward to today, employees have been leaving our company for higher wages as the businesses that laid-off employees are trying to attract people to come back to work for them.","During the first quarter of 2021, the total number of apartment industry job postings increased by 8 percent over the previous five-year average. Employers are turning to those unemployed and dislocated by other service sector industries hardest hit by the pandemic, such as retail and hospitality, hoping to hire candidates with transferrable skills and work experiences into the apartment industry.","It was coming already in the last couple of years, but the pandemic accelerated the demand for digital skills, and we only expect that to increase, particularly as we see virtual events continuing to be an important part of our offerings to members.","Our industry is reporting challenges finding workers for their manufacturing facilities and contending with labor shortages throughout the supply chain. While the truck driver shortage is not a new problem, labor issues at the front end of the supply chain (raw inputs and ingredients) are exacerbating the problems they have finding workers for their own ranks. Demand for CPG products has been relentless throughout the pandemic and has accelerated in the first quarter of 2021. This past March was the second-highest demand we\u2019ve seen since March 2020, when panic buying swept store shelves clean\u2014and the more recent sales numbers show only a 1.4% dip from the year before. The CPG workforce is essential and has been operating throughout the pandemic, leading to increased wages across the industry. Despite paying employees more, the CPG industry added only 4,300 jobs last month. The number is made starker when considered against job openings data that shows 572,000 openings in all manufacturing, up from 537,000 the month before \u2014 and the surge in unfilled jobs is primarily in nondurable goods manufacturing, which jumped 20% this month.","In the area of leadership, we are challenged with finding leaders who have the business acumen specific to the airport/aviation industry and who are also able to lead a diverse workforce. Specific and emerging areas that are hardest to fill are executive-level positions in engineering, information technology, and cybersecurity. Diversity of the talent pool remains a challenge. As the airport and aviation sector rebounds from the COVID crisis, the greatest challenge is to rapidly respond to the need to replace the workforce that took early retirement, were laid off, or engaged in alternate employment (consulting or leaving the field). The lack of predictability as to how quickly domestic and international travel will rebound is a challenging metric when it comes to workforce planning.","It is predicted that leasing roles may remain lower as prospective residents have become accustomed to leasing virtually and management firms have adapted to the technologies that have supported them throughout the pandemic. Advanced training that includes upgrading skills in customer service, communications, and computer skills to accommodate changing job descriptions is expected.","ESCO Manufacturing, located in Watertown, SD, faces a considerable challenge to fill open positions with qualified applicants. Our local community is filled with many manufacturing companies, all vying for the same types of applicants, specifically welding and painting. This has created an unusual labor market in which our previous pay scales, based on real market data, have essentially been \u201cthrown out the window.\u201d Post-pandemic, the wages within the labor market are being driven up by employees testing the waters with other companies, which has increased their expected wages. While this is a good thing from the employee perspective, it creates a trickle-down effect for the employer and pricing structure.","Key Stat: Employees in the fuel industry earn more than the national median.1 Filling unskilled jobs under $19.00 have become increasingly difficult due to current COVID-related unemployment benefits. After 14 months of managing 24-hour operations during a pandemic, our operations have started to implement de-escalation management plans inclusive of the encouragement of getting the vaccine.","The 15,700 + establishments of the U.S. plastics industry kept working during the pandemic to continue producing life-saving materials and products that the healthcare industry and the consumers needed in response to COVID-19. However, the plastics industry lost jobs as the economy shut down. Based on PLASTICS\u2019 estimate, the plastic materials and resin production sector employment decreased 3.5% while the plastics products manufacturing employment fell 3.2%. Although plastics machinery manufacturing saw a 1.7% increase in employment, molds of plastics manufacturing employment decreased 2.8%.","It is wrong to assume that because the multiemployer crisis began before COVID-19 it is unrelated to or immune from the effects of the pandemic. The economic drag on plans, employers, and workers is profound. If Congress\u2019 priority is to strengthen the confidence of retirees, small businesses, and essential workers during these uncertain times, then it should pass multiemployer relief without further delay. To do otherwise would make the solution more expensive and more complex. We urge Congress to pass the multiemployer pension relief in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and support the more than 200,000 businesses and 10.9 million workers and retirees that contribute to, and rely on, the multiemployer pension system.","Letter supporting the multiemployer pension relief provisions in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 as essential COVID-19 relief","$200,000 of additional withdrawal liability. The staggering withdrawal liability also harms employers\u2019 ability to secure affordable financing because financial institutions are hesitant to do business with companies that have significant withdrawal liability exposure. As employers struggle to survive the pandemic, the adverse effects of the multiemployer crisis increase their obstacles for hiring and prospects for a strong recovery.","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on plan funding levels. As contributions to multiemployer plans are largely based on hours worked, thedramatic decline in economic activity, business closures, and employee furloughs caused by COVID-19 reduced pension contributions at a time when plans can least afford it. Government-mandated lockdowns have impacted plans in the retail, entertainment, and food services industries. As plans have become more reliant on employer contributions (because of their funding status), the negative impacts from the pandemic are even more detrimental to their outlook.","Employers recognize the multiemployer crisis began before the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have been striving to find a sustainable solution to this crisis for many years. However, the economic consequences of COVID-19 have exacerbated the challenges facing many multiemployer plans, employers, and essential workers - making immediate relief absolutely essential.","Data is used for societally beneficial purposes such as research, fraud detection, financial inclusion, public safety, and improving health outcomes. The data-driven economy is helping keep the \u201cdigital lights\u201d on for many businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is imperative that consumers trust that their privacy is respected.","Intellectual Property Drives Economic Prosperity as World Emerges from Pandemic, New Report Shows",'5. Despite the critical role IP played in response to the pandemic, some World Trade Organization (WTO) members continued to push a proposal to "waive" international IP commitments.',"IP is at the heart of the solutions that emerged to combat COVID-19, from cures like vaccines, therapeutics, and medical technologies to connections like virtual meeting software and 5G. The Index shows that it's no coincidence that these solutions originated almost exclusively in economies with strong IP systems, not to mention that access to these solutions was greatest in economies with strong IP systems. That's because strong IP systems enable allocation of resources, forming partnerships, and transferring technology on commercial terms. For example, robust IP systems facilitated hundreds of voluntary licensing agreements that powered the rapid scale-up of global manufacturing, especially in the life sciences industry. As of January 2022, there were nearly 330 voluntary partnerships and collaborations among manufacturers facilitating the production of billions of doses of vaccines and over 110 voluntary partnerships enabling the production of therapeutics, all supported by the contractual licensing of IP rights. As a result, by June 2022, global vaccine manufacturing capacity is anticipated to reach 24 billion doses.","4. IP-intensive goods and services were critical to the global response to COVID-19.","Although the Index and other trusted research demonstrate that robust IP systems\xa0help\xa0drive innovation and access to innovation, some world leaders mischaracterize IP protections as barriers to innovation and access to innovation. That misconception is the basis of a recent WTO proposal: It aims to waive many of the international IP commitments in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which establishes the minimum standards for international IP protection and, yet, has never been fully or faithfully implemented by most WTO member countries, as reflected in the Index. Such a waiver would intensify market uncertainty, discouraging innovators from pursuing new ideas and taking risks, and thus, harm ongoing and potential efforts to solve COVID-19 and other critical issues.","The Chamber supported ICE\u2019s March 20, 2020 announcement that initially provided the flexibility to remotely perform the I-9 document verification. We continue to support the extension of these temporary policies through April 30, 2022.1 There were many companies who used this policy flexibility to effectively onboard much-needed workers during the height of the pandemic. In doing so, these companies avoided critical workforce disruptions. However, there were many employers that, due to the critical shortcomings associated with the temporary policy, either declined to take advantage of the temporary policy flexibility altogether, or only made use of these policies for a brief period.","With regard to those temporary employees who have since left the employment of the company that performed the I-9 document verification for the employee virtually, there is a lack of guidance as to what companies should do to verify former employees, notwithstanding the statutory record retention requirements and the ability of the company to copy the documents under the INA.2 As for the workers that were onboarded by a company using these virtual procedures and are still employed by said company, it is simply impractical for a business that onboarded thousands of people using virtual means to perform a physical inspection of the identity and employment eligibility documentation for thousands of workers in a 72 hour period. The disruption that this would cause for firms in this type of situation would have been significant. As such, this single concern drove many companies to not make use of the virtual verification option. Moreover, even for those companies that chose to take advantage of this flexibility during the height of the pandemic, a significant number of those companies discontinued using the virtual option to avoid potential liability for violations that could have arisen if they needed to verify their workers\u2019 documentation in short order.","In order for DHS to implement the most impactful policy changes to the employment verification process, it must provide businesses with more certainty and guidance as to what documents are acceptable for individuals to submit for the purposes of complying with federal employment verification requirements. Specifically, DHS should give employers more flexibility to accept electronic documents or document copies instead of the original hard copy, which would significantly reduce the burdens on employers and employees alike, as well as prevent workforce disruptions. USCIS should update the M-274 Handbook for Employers to clarify that employers may accept electronic USCIS approval notices for Form I-9 purposes. USCIS processing delays, coupled with U.S. Postal Service delays due to COVID-19, frequently leave employers with no choice but to suspend employment when an employee has an electronic USCIS approval notice but has not yet received the physical notice in the mail. These types of disruptions would be easily avoidable if electronic documents and copies of documents were acceptable for the purposes of validating one\u2019s employment eligibility in the U.S.","Companies that took advantage of the remote document examination policy established in March 2020 improved the onboarding experience not only for their businesses, but also for their employees. Chamber members found the remote process to be much more efficient and cost-effective than the traditional in-person procedure. Given the difficulties many businesses had to confront during the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies conveyed to us that the ability to perform the document verification process virtually was indispensable in allowing them to continue both onboarding new hires and reverifying the documents for existing employees whose documents had expired. These temporary measures allowed many companies to avoid significant workforce disruptions during the worst periods of the pandemic.","Many companies that elected not to utilize the virtual verification process, or discontinue the use of it, chose to conduct in-person document reviews where \u201cauthorized representatives\u201d performed the in-person document review. The practice of using authorized representatives/agents to perform the in-person document review had been exercised by employers prior to the pandemic. However, many chamber members conveyed to us that they used this option sparingly prior to the pandemic, as they remained liable for any errors made by their agents during this process. The use of agents provided needed flexibility for companies, but there remained several challenges for companies that left many businesses hungry for a virtual verification process that would have been workable for them. The challenges with this method of document verification included:","Relatedly, there have been several policy changes implemented by DHS and USCIS that have impacted what documents are sufficient to determine an individual\u2019s employment eligibility in the U.S. For example, USCIS expanded the eligibility for an automatic 180-day Employment Authorization Document (EAD) extension to the dependent spouses of H-1B, and L-1, and E nonimmigrant workers. To that end, USCIS clarified that E and L dependent spouses are to be considered work authorized incident to their status, regardless if they physically possess an EAD. There have also been many other temporary policy changes caused by COVID where the agency is providing employers with flexibility regarding certain documentation. DHS should clarify these policy changes publicly and provide employers with easy access to this guidance. The business community and workers would benefit greatly from additional clarity.","Several companies reported to us that since the pandemic began, they\u2019ve onboarded thousands of workers. In some cases, many of the employees onboarded by these companies have never set foot inside a company facility, and within this cohort, a significant number of those workers were employed on a temporary basis and are no longer employed by these firms.","The Chamber urges Congress to provide timely, targeted, and temporary support to state and local governments. Unfortunately, the proposals for state and local aid unveiled to date are not targeted and will result in many jurisdictions receiving more support than they likely require, while potentially shortchanging others.\xa0 Under the formulas used in the House-passed Heroes Act (which utilize a minimum distribution plus formulas based on COVID cased and unemployment), it is possible that some states will receive aid over the next year that exceeds a year\u2019s worth of their general-fund budget. Other states will receive substantially less. Aid will not reflect actual costs or foregone revenue. While reducing the overall amount of spending will reduce the cost of taxpayers, it will do nothing to address that the aid is poorly targeted.","Address the multiemployer funding crisis, which is significantly worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, by establishing a partition program for troubled plans, shoring up the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation\u2019s (PBGC) multiemployer programs, and enacting meaningful structural reforms, such as zone rule changes, that will reform the system rather than harm it.","Ensure there is no interruption in services by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection at our ports of entry. The U.S. economy relies on the safe and efficient movement of goods and people across our borders. However, the enormous drop in trade and travelers at our ports of entry due to the coronavirus, particularly air traffic, is creating massive deficits in CBP\u2019s border operations budget that may force cuts in service if left unaddressed. It is critical that CBP have the budgetary resources to support the American public and business community as international travel and trade increases.","At this time, it is appropriate for Congress to take a more targeted approach: closing the gaps that existed in the CARES Act programs and providing additional relief for those businesses that cannot return to more normal operations as a result of the social distancing requirements necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Enact legislation to assist state and local governments with cybersecurity. These governments are under siege by an unprecedented number of cyberattacks perpetrated by malicious actors, costing taxpayers\u2019 substantial sums and threatening constituents\u2019 privacy. These attacks have increased exponentially since March 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.","Healthcare providers and facilities on the front lines of the COVID-19 response.","Establish an employer-provided health insurance continuation subsidy for workers who involuntarily lost their jobs between the period that began on March 1, 2020, and ends 60 days after the announced end of the COVID-19 National Emergency (EBSA Relief Period).","Support wastewater monitoring programs to enhance health detection capabilities.\xa0 Global and U.S. studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus is present in wastewater since it is discharged in the feces of individuals who have the virus, including those who are asymptomatic.\xa0 Wastewater can provide valuable information as a leading indicator for national, state, and local government decision-makers. Utilities currently collect samples, but more technical analysis is needed, supported by appropriate federal programs and investments from either EPA or DHS/FEMA.","Target funding for airports and surface transportation networks to ensure these critical investments are not harmed or delayed by the loss of revenue caused by the pandemic.","Suspend tariffs for the next 90 days on the medical supplies identified by the U.S. International Trade Commission in its May 4 report on imports relevant to U.S. pandemic response. The Administration has emergency authorities that would allow this action. Lifting tariffs on medical supplies would help America\u2019s health care workers and first responders stay safe by assisting them in obtaining medical supplies speedily and economically. This action would also facilitate a safe resumption of normal economic activity, given the wide range of industries that will rely on these imports to operate safely in the months ahead.","Congress can build on the aid provided in the CARES Act to help employers address urgent liquidity needs, including by allowing the monetization of additional tax attributes like general business credits. This would provide businesses timely access to tax benefits existing on their books. In addition, Congress should provide tax relief for losses due to the Coronavirus pandemic; and modify international tax provisions to maximize the benefits of CARES Act tax relief.","Just as the pandemic caused a sudden, unanticipated drop in business receipts, it has done the same for state and local government revenue. Absent additional federal assistance, state and local outlays and employment will have to be quickly cut, deepening, and lengthening the economic downturn.","Businesses and other entities that work to follow government guidelines against COVID-19 exposure claims.","Allow participation in the CARES Act-provided funding for a temporary telehealth program for all hospitals, including hospitals structured as for-profit entities, that demonstrate their ability to serve patients in places with need. Telemedicine programs are helping doctors and hospitals treat patients in ways to reduce potential contact with those exposed to COVID-19.","Employers can expect to see a significant increase in unemployment insurance taxes in 2021 unless Congress takes action to ensure that states do not charge benefits against contributing employer\u2019s accounts during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Congress should provide funding to local education agencies to offset the direct costs of COVID-related safety modifications and general support to help offset a portion of lost locally generated revenue.","Employers across the country continue to struggle with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus. The impact, however, is not the same across industries. As of June, some sectors of the economy have essentially restored all the jobs lost since February. Other sectors \u2013 particularly those most impacted by closures and social distancing requirements where remote work is not possible \u2013 have faced catastrophic revenue and job loss. As part of the CARES Act, Congress appropriately provided broad-based support for employers through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, the Main Street Lending Facilities, the Employee Retention Tax Credit, and other tax provisions.","At the same time, state and local governments will also face new and increased costs as a result of the coronavirus. This will include direct costs such as measurers to implement greater social distancing, as well as increased public benefit costs as a result of the recession.","Recognize forced closings due to the coronavirus pandemic as unforeseeable circumstances under the WARN Act to relieve affected businesses of having to satisfy the Act\u2019s notice requirements.","An assistance-eligible individual is generally an individual (1) who is a qualified beneficiary as the result of an involuntary termination during the period from March 1, 2020, through 60 days after the announced end of the COVID-19 National Emergency, (2) who is eligible for COBRA continuation coverage at any time during that period, and (3) who elects the coverage. Group health plans must generally treat assistance-eligible individuals who pay 12 percent of the premium otherwise payable for COBRA continuation coverage as having paid the full amount of the premium.","Delay the implementation of Sec. 889, part B (F.Y. 2019 NDAA) to August 13, 2021. If part B is implemented as written, many businesses with international and domestic operations will be forced to halt their work, providing vital products and services to agencies, such as defense technologies and personal protective equipment, that are needed to fight COVID-19.","It is worth noting that under the CARES Act and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, parents may be eligible for federally-funded unemployment or paid leave if their child is unable to attend in-person school or childcare. Making investments now to ensure the safe reopening of schools and childcare centers will likely reduce federal spending in other areas.","As if the pandemic and the economic downturn were not enough, employers are confronting the possibility of unwarranted lawsuits related to COVID that threaten their ability to operate and the economy\u2019s ability to recover. The Chamber calls on Congress to pass timely, temporary, and targeted liability relief that will provide employers, healthcare providers, non-profits, and educational institutions a safe harbor from these types of lawsuits when they make good-faith efforts to follow applicable public health guidelines.","As part of the CARES Act, numerous tax provisions were enacted on a temporary basis to help businesses address liquidity issues. Given the expected time required to return to the pre-pandemic economy, a further extension of these tax provisions is warranted.","Include emergency resources to respond to the global economic, health, and humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. Recognizing the global reach of COVID-19 and the grim reality that its toll elsewhere will directly impact Americans in all walks of life, these additional resources are needed to assist in the prevention, identification, and treatment of COVID-19 overseas. As we chart a path toward economic recovery, these funds will help ensure American companies continue to have access to consumers abroad, maintain their global competitiveness, and don\u2019t lose market share to our global competitors.","We have not yet beaten the coronavirus or achieved the economic recovery we all desire. Additional support is needed from the government to curtail the pandemic and to support individuals, families, and employers through this unprecedented downturn.","A safe-harbor will ensure that bad actors can be held accountable while simultaneously protecting those entities who are working to follow public health guidance. Specifically, the Chamber calls on Congress to put in place temporary protections for the duration of the pandemic crisis and response that cover:","Provide tax relief for remote worker issues stemming from the Coronavirus pandemic.","The Department of the Treasury/Internal Revenue Service should delay any employee benefit filings or actions due on and after July 15, 2020, to align with the time outlined in DOL Notice 2020-1 (namely, 60 days after the end of the coronavirus National Emergency).","Congress should provide targeted funding to offset a portion of the direct costs of COVID-related safety modifications and limited subsidies when occupancy limits constrain provider revenue.","Oppose any artificial extension of the emergency declaration aimed at preventing legitimate recovery efforts.\xa0 Creditors who have been providing goods and services at discounted or zero cost during the pandemic should be permitted to commence reasonable accounts receivable recovery efforts once the President\u2019s emergency declaration has ended, consistent with all applicable consumer protection rules and regulations.\xa0 Any artificial extensions of the emergency period by Congress would be counterproductive to recovery and would impose unnecessary stress upon the liquidity and continued reliable operations of critical infrastructure providers and other essential businesses.","Congress should work to apportion aid in a manner that (1) reimburses state and local governments for direct COVID response costs and (2) replaces a portion, say 90 percent, of forgone revenue based on the difference between quarterly pre-COVID revenue projections and actual receipts (or receipts in the corresponding quarter in 2019). Replacing only a portion of the lost revenue will encourage shared sacrifice and economization. Providing support on a quarterly basis will ensure that as the economy and state revenue recovers, aid is reduced. This approach may not be possible for local aid, in which case Congress should create clear parameters to ensure aid is directly tied to actual, realized losses.","The CARES Act created an Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) that provided an effective $5,000 refundable tax credit to employers negatively impacted by the economic fallout from the pandemic. Congress should increase the size of the credit, make the credit more flexible by allowing small and midsize employers to claim the credit irrespective of whether the employee is \u201cproviding services,\u201d and expanding the universe of eligible employers by reducing the reduction in gross receipts required to access the credit. Congress can simultaneously make the expanded credit more targeted by reducing the benefit for employers who are experiencing less of a revenue loss.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and its members applaud the Administration and Congress for the actions taken this spring to mitigate the direct and indirect economic effects of the coronavirus on the American people. We are especially grateful for the bipartisan approach that led to the enactment of the CARES Act and related legislation.","At no other point in recent history has the need for immigration reform been greater than it is today. Simply put, the system is broken. Millions of workers, many of whom were indispensable to America\u2019s COVID-19 response, are living in legal jeopardy. Apprehensions at the southern border are at historic highs. Employers are also struggling to find workers to fill jobs in many industries.","Modernizing our immigration system is a step toward alleviating many concerns that are weighing heavily on the minds of American citizens today. Americans are concerned about the ongoing economic recovery from COVID-19, persistent labor shortages and supply chain challenges, rising inflation, and border security. This Alliance is elevating those voices and ready to work with Congress on bipartisan solutions that can be passed today.","Here are five reasons born from the pandemic but likely to last long after it is gone for why people are looking to switch careers more than ever before.","Historically, people looked to switch careers for more money, better benefits, and more advancement opportunities, among other reasons. What\u2019s different about this wave of career switchers, however, is that while the traditional reasons for changing careers are still important considerations, they aren\u2019t the only ones or even the most important ones anymore, says Deb Broberg, Executive Director of RealTime Talent and a U.S. Chamber Talent Pipeline Management fellow. She says the pandemic prompted people to reevaluate want they want from a career and made them realize things like work-life balance, flexible scheduling, and a positive culture were just as important, if not more important for some, than money and benefits.","Lost amid the headlines about people quitting their jobs and companies being unable to find workers to fill open positions is another, perhaps more worrisome trend for business leaders \u2014 the fact that people are switching careers, or moving from one industry into a completely different one, more frequently than ever before. According to a recent U.S. Chamber poll, for instance, 32% of people who lost their job during the pandemic and remain unemployed say they are looking to work in a different industry for their next job. A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll found similar results, with one-third of workers under the age of 40 considering changing careers or switching industries since the pandemic. It\u2019s a dynamic that has the power to send shockwaves through the talent pools of entire industries, prompting businesses to rethink their approach to hiring and retention.","The financial damage wrought by the pandemic can be quantified, but the mental and emotional toll cannot. There is still a very real fear factor for workers on the frontlines \u2014 from nurses and other healthcare professionals to restaurant and retail workers \u2014 whose jobs involve high-contact interactions with other people. Burnout, anxiety, and other mental health issues are prompting these workers to switch industries. A recent survey of critical care nurses found that 66% have considered leaving their jobs because of the pandemic, citing fear of exposing themselves or their families to COVID-19 as the main reason. \u201cMany industries require people to be on the ground doing work with other people,\u201d says Broberg. \u201cThere is certainly still some degree of fear factor today, the question is whether that fear will continue and if so to what degree. We can\u2019t say with confidence that people will forget this quickly.\u201d","It\u2019s clear that the move to remote work is not a temporary condition caused by the pandemic but a permanent feature of the new world of work. People aren\u2019t likely to relocate for a job anymore, and with the pressure businesses are under to fill open jobs, they aren\u2019t likely to request that candidates move as a condition of employment either. Together, those two dynamics mean that employers have a much wider canvas for recruiting, and workers have a much bigger palette of companies to which they can apply.","Not unlike the restaurant manager getting into the insurance industry, many workers in hospitality, traditional retail, and other industries hit hard by the pandemic are intentionally looking for opportunities to transfer skills into growth industries. According to the U.S. Chamber poll, 46% of workers previously employed in the leisure/hospitality industry are looking to switch industries. Pointing to leadership, sales, and communication skills, Broberg, whose organization works with private companies and public institutions to improve the alignment of talent with employer needs, says, \u201cRestaurant managers have a lot of skills that overlap with many insurance industry roles.\u201d","Forty-one percent of respondents to the U.S. Chamber COVID-19 unemployed poll said a positive work environment would increase their urgency to return to work, while another 31% said they would go back to work if they found a career that offers them a chance to make a difference. Those statistics underscore a trend among workers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, to seek out businesses and jobs that align with their values. And while that trend began well before the COVID-19, the pandemic\u2019s devastating financial and social impacts certainly accelerated the desire among a vast cohort of workers to seek out businesses with inclusive cultures and jobs that positively contribute to society, says Broberg.","In May there were\xa09.3 million workers unemployed and 9.2 million job openings. As the number of unemployed closes in on the number of job openings, employers will have to look beyond the native workforce.\xa0May\u2019s\xa0Worker Availability Ratio\u2013the ratio of available workers to job openings\u2013was 1.2,\xa0similar to\xa0what it was before the pandemic.","In Las Vegas, recovering from pandemic lockdowns has been difficult, especially for hospitality businesses like restaurants, hotels, and resorts.\xa0\u201cOne local restaurant had to close one of their two restaurants because they can\u2019t find the workers to handle the increased demand,\u201d explained Mary Beth Seward, President and CEO of the Vegas Chamber. \u201cAnd they\u2019re one of hundreds of stories.\u201d","Global Task Force on Pandemic Response\u202fAnnounces\u202fAdditional Aid for Southeast Asia\u2019s COVID-19 Response \u2013 Boosting Diagnostic Capabilities","We stand as a nation in a moment of great consequence. While the United States seems to be gaining control of the pandemic, our allies in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa face increasingly deadly outbreaks that threaten to overwhelm their healthcare systems. Aid and assistance to people in need has been a hallmark of U.S. foreign policy for well over a century. The world has come to rely upon U.S. leadership at times of great strife. The ability of our government, working in tandem with the private sector, to deliver innovative solu- tions that save lives and restore peace and stability is the very foundation of U.S. soft power. Today we have a generational opportunity to mobilize vaccine efforts around the world. Our friends and allies will not forget easily if we sit on surplus stockpiles of the most proven vaccines as their citizens suffer and die.","Your Administration has committed $4 billion to Covax, the multilateral effort headed by the WHO to get vac- cines into the arms of people in disadvantaged nations. You have also announced your intention to donate 60 million doses of our supply of Astra Zeneca vaccine for global deployment. While these actions are a laudable and necessary start, by themselves they are far too small in scale to turn the tide of the global pandemic. We must do more. This is not only a matter of geopolitics. With the virus teeming unchecked in places like India, the Philippines, and elsewhere, it becomes increasingly possible for dangerous variants to evolve that are resis- tant to the existing vaccines. Such variants will know no borders.","The Path Forward: Dr. Fauci Urges Americans to Get Their COVID Booster","The Chamber is ensuring the business community is ready for any scenario, but urges that the response to the coronavirus is grounded in facts, not driven by fear.  The Chamber\u2019s website is designed to be a resource for business leaders and others, linking to the latest CDC information and state and local health officials.  The Chamber believes that businesses, working with government, can help instill the confidence and calm that is necessary both to contain the coronavirus and maintain economic growth.","U.S. Chamber Letter on H.R. 6074, the \u201cCoronavirus Preparadness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020,\u201d (March 4, 2020).  Available at: https://www.uschamber.com/letters-congress/us-chamber-letter-hr-6074-the-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-supplemental.","Thank you for holding the hearing tomorrow entitled, \u201cThe Coronavirus and America\u2019s Small Business Supply Chain.\u201d","On behalf of the Chamber, thank you for working in an expeditious and bipartisan manner to pass the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act last week.  Because of Congress and the President\u2019s quick action, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) can provide $7 billion in low-interest loans to small businesses impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19).  We supported this legislation and view this hearing as an important oversight function to help guide the effective distribution of resources made available under the $8.3 billion package and to explore what further action may be necessary to help small businesses weather the coronavirus outbreak.","Re:  Statement for the Record; Hearing on the Coronavirus and America\u2019s Small Business Supply Chain","On Friday, March 6, the Chamber launched four task forces to prepare businesses for any potential long-term economic effects of the coronavirus.  In addition to the task forces on Employee Support, Business Operational and Revenue Disruption, and Supply Chain and Trade Disruption, a task force will focus exclusively on addressing the unique needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.","The coronavirus was certainly part of the conversation at our Small Business Council meeting that was held earlier this week in Miami.  As business owners, we are laser focused on working to ensure the safety of our employees and, at the same time, ensure continuity of operations.  I am proud that the Chamber continues to operate at 100 percent. In addition to our Small Business Council meeting in the Chairman\u2019s home state, the Chamber is holding events in Austin, Minneapolis, Jacksonville, and San Diego this week.","Today, we released our latest MetLife and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Small Business Index.  Our findings from the first quarter of the year reveal the highest level of confidence in the history of our Index. This is important because it shows the strength of the small business sector at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, which will help the sector weather the weeks and months ahead.","As the country quickly approaches year three of the COVID-19 pandemic, empty grocery store shelves, delayed packages, and an insufficient supply of everything from refrigerators to microchips has become commonplace.","Small businesses across the board, however, seem to agree that supply chain disruptions will not be resolved any time soon. Of the small businesses that said the pandemic disrupted their supply chains, 64% think these disruptions will last six months or more.","Small businesses in the retail sector report the greatest impacts from supply chain challenges. More than three in four (78%) retail businesses said the pandemic has disrupted their business\u2019 supply chain. Three in five (61%) retailers say these disruptions leave them unable to keep up with customer demand \u2013 compared to 47% for other sectors.","According to the Q4 2021 U.S. Chamber and MetLife Small Business Index, 61% of small businesses said their supply chains have been disrupted by the pandemic and worker shortages. As a result, 63% say they have had to alter their supply chains in the past six months.","The legislation also prohibits employers from terminating an employee for COVID-19 vaccine-related mandates if the employee complies with the employer\u2019s exemption process requirements. This clause will make employees who are fired over COVID-19 vaccines eligible for unemployment insurance (UI). Without specific carve-outs such as this one, workers who are fired for failing to comply with a vaccine mandate typically would be ineligible for UI.","The new law will require employers to provide COVID-19 vaccine mandate exemptions to employees. Employers can do this by either requiring employees to produce a negative COVID-19 test once per week or proof of immunity, i.e. antibodies, twice per year. If the employee\u2019s health care plan does not cover the testing, costs will be covered by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA), state, or other federal funding. If such funding is unavailable, the employee must cover the cost.","Right now, the United States and our allies in the Indo-Pacific are navigating the challenges of a post-pandemic recovery\u2014with high inflation, talent shortages, and supply chain bottlenecks.\xa0 Our adversaries assume we lack both the economic confidence and capacity for coordination needed to counter these challenges, leading them to question our leadership on the world stage.","Class Deviation 2021-O0009 was recently released by DPC.  The Deviation implements the requirements of Executive Order 14042 \u2013 Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors.  The actions directed by the Executive Order will ensure parties who contract with the Federal Government provide adequate COVID-19 safeguards in workplaces with individuals working on or in connection with a Federal Government contract or contract-like instrument.

This is especially critical, as many less-developed countries are heavily reliant on tourism for jobs and economic growth.","Traveling during COVID-19? Review the latest CDC guidance for domestic travel and international travel.","COVID-19 hit the travel industry hard. Business travel, one of the industry\u2019s primary sources of revenue, came to an abrupt halt. On the leisure travel side, vacations and special events were put on hold, damaging the tourism sector as well.","\"The 'new normal' of a post-pandemic world is expected to have long-term impacts on the travel and tourism industries.\"The impact of vaccine inequity on the tourism sector","The \u201cnew normal\u201d of a post-pandemic world is expected to have long-term impacts on the travel and tourism industries.","While the travel and tourism industries are slowly starting to recover, the emergence of the Delta variant has slowed growth and created uncertainty around when business and leisure travel will return to pre-pandemic levels. Here\u2019s what businesses need to know to make informed decisions about traveling for their employees and customers amid this changing landscape.","Despite the relative safety of air travel, companies are still being cautious. The survey found that only 40% of companies planned to restart domestic trips within the next one to three months, while a mere 18% of companies planned to restart international trips. Their caution is owed to concerns over the presence of COVID-19 variants. Among survey participants, 78% were \u201cconcerned\u201d or \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the effects of the delta variant, as well as the possibility of further variants, on the safety of business travel.","The delta variant has slowed growth and created uncertainty around when travel and tourism will return to pre-pandemic levels.","The loss in air travel has also negatively impacted the tourism sector. Reduced demand for travel has similarly reduced demand for hotels, restaurants and food service, local retail, entertainment, and events. In 2020, international tourism and its related sectors saw a loss of $2.4 trillion due to the effects of the pandemic.","As countries look toward fiscal and public health recovery, business travel and leisure travel are also beginning to recover. However, it is unlikely that things will return to the way they were before COVID-19. Rather, businesses must adjust to the \u201cnew normal\u201d of travel to stay competitive and best support their employees and customers.","Recovery in travel and tourism will largely depend on global vaccine distribution and the suppression of COVID-19 variants. According to the GBTA survey, approximately 1 in 5 participants reported their company required employees to be vaccinated before traveling domestically. With different countries and even states having their own set of restrictions and vaccination status guidelines, organizations may hold off on business travel until these requirements can be streamlined or more easily understood.","Amid the pandemic, both domestic and international destinations have placed varying restrictions on travel. In addition to public health concerns, logistical factors like required COVID-19 testing and quarantine periods have significantly reduced where and how often people are traveling. Moreover, many airports and other transportation hubs have been operating with fewer staff, limiting both the efficiency of traveling and options for doing so. The reduction in both business travel and leisure travel cost the airline industry more than $100 billion in lost revenue in 2020, and estimates project a further loss of nearly $50 billion this year.","Contactless technology has seen a rise in recent years, but it has become more widespread than ever amid the pandemic. According to a survey by the U.S. Travel Association, 41% of global transactions are currently carried out through contact-free means, and 74% of Americans plan to continue using touch-free tech even post-pandemic. Apps that allow for contactless check-ins, direct payments, and even mobile hotel keys are expected to increase in popularity over the next several years.","On the leisure travel side, people will likely continue to explore their own backyards more frequently than pre-pandemic. The summer of 2020 saw an uptick in road trips across America, with people choosing destinations within driving distance and further away from crowded metropolitan cities.","While the pandemic has certainly impacted the labor market, the lack of workers to fill open jobs isn\u2019t a new problem. In late 2019, there were more open jobs than unemployed individuals. Keeping our economy growing requires that we fill these jobs. To do so, we need to remove barriers that prevent people from entering the workforce, get individuals the skills they need for the open positions, and enact sensible immigration policy.","Businesses only created 266,000 jobs when most analysts expected more than 1 million. Even with 9.7 million unemployed at the beginning of April, workers\u2019 reluctance to return to work and fill open positions was one reason for the lackluster job creation. Another could be that employees know just how easy it is to get a new job \u2013 the percent voluntarily leaving their current job is now above pre-pandemic levels.","Ninety percent reported \u201clack of available workers\u201d as the main factor slowing the economy in their area\u2014with two-thirds reporting it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d for employers in their community or state to hire workers. Respondents were twice as likely to say that lack of workers is holding back the economy as they are to say that COVID is holding it back. Less than 1% said it was easy to fill open jobs.","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted all small businesses, but minority-owned businesses were disproportionately affected. A special report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and MetLife found that, as of August 2020, two in three (66%) minority small businesses were concerned about having to permanently close their business, versus 57% for non-minority small businesses.","U.S. Chamber Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley issued the following statement today after the announcement of President Biden\u2019s new action plan for the winter months to combat the new COVID-19 Delta and Omicron variants:","\u201cWe encourage employers to find ways to remove barriers to vaccination by providing workers with paid time off to get their first, second, or booster shot.\xa0As all of us continue to learn to live with the coronavirus, it is reassuring to see that the CDC is working on new science-based policies that are intended to ensure children remain safe while reducing the risk of unnecessary disruptions that interrupt their education or make it hard for parents or caregivers to work.\u201d","\u201cWe echo the sentiment expressed today by President Biden that no business should have to shut down this winter because of COVID-19. Vaccines are the most effective way to stop the spread of this deadly virus.","I think it's shown that business is and should be an essential part of the solution and that together we're better. When I think about what we were able to accomplish at U.S. Bank; we moved most of our workforce to work remotely. We moved wealth management bankers to support other banking teams. We moved branch employees to assist our call centers with responding to the high volume of customers in need. We took our entire philanthropic plan for the year and shifted it to support COVID-19.","The third thing I would say is to think about the disparate impact of this pandemic on underserved communities and people of color. And that's why the investments that we're making in low-to-moderate income communities in response to COVID-19 are so important. Our investments will continue to focus on equity now, and when we emerge from the current pandemic state.","Our response to COVID-19 at U.S. Bank is focused on supporting our employees, customers, and communities.","Q: How is the coronavirus pandemic different than other disasters or crises you\u2019ve responded to? Do you have any lessons learned or best practices you\u2019d like to share with the larger business community as they navigate their response?","The U.S. Chamber Foundation\u2019s Corporate Citizenship Center is interviewing business leaders driving the global corporate response to COVID-19 to learn more about their efforts, how they are navigating this uncharted territory, and what advice they have for others.","Read on to hear from Reba Dominski, executive vice president of U.S. Bank and chief social responsibility officer and president of the U.S. Bank Foundation, to learn how the bank shifted operations and focused on supporting small businesses. What follows has been edited and condensed for clarity.Q: Can you tell us a little about your efforts at U.S. Bank to address the impacts of COVID-19?","I think this is unprecedented. As a global enterprise, we've continued to closely monitor the spread of COVID-19 and have taken steps to minimize the impact of the virus on our employees, customers, and operations. The safety and well-being of our employees was core to our response. Our efforts have been coordinated by this incredible centralized command center with all of our key teams involved to help streamline our response and recovery activities across the entire operation.","We\u2019ve also found small ways to adapt as a business. For example, we have a food truck we have been using to help promote small businesses in our markets while sharing details of our mobile banking options. With the pandemic, the truck was sitting idle. Recognizing that it could be repurposed, our team in Arizona came up with an idea to use the truck to help local food banks deliver food to individuals and families in need. I have just been amazed and truly impressed by the creativity and collaboration of our entire U.S. Bank team.","Our employees are at the heart of everything we do. Financial services, like health care companies and grocery providers, are considered critical services. Across our entire operation, we are taking steps to protect the safety of our employees and customers. We\u2019ve temporarily adjusted the operation of our branches. We\u2019ve decreased lobby use, encouraged drive-through, and wherever possible, we're consolidating operations. In March, we announced a premium pay program that provides our critical frontline employees with a temporary 20% hourly wage increase. We\u2019re also providing additional paid time off for employees affected by COVID-19.","Additionally, we announced a $30 million commitment to support COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts in communities across the country. Initially within two weeks, we put $4 million in grants into the hands of three of our most trusted national partners: LISC, United Way, and Operation Hope. By year end, we will have provided an additional $26 million that will serve as general operating funds for local non-profits to support financial education, affordable housing work assistance and arts and culture institutions.","As the coronavirus continues to bring a great deal of uncertainty to our world, one thing is clear: the business community is on the frontlines of the fight against the pandemic, demonstrating unparalleled agility and innovation to help our country navigate this health and economic crisis as fast and effectively as possible.","Ensuring Adequate COVID Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors","Pandemic related shocks combined with a tight labor market, and loose monetary and fiscal policy have limited the supply of many goods and at the very same time boosted demand with an obvious result: broad based price increases.",'The following statement on the Biden administration\u2019s announcement to support international negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) can be attributed to U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer, Neil Bradley:"The administration has gotten this issue wrong; undermining intellectual property rights for complex, hard to manufacture vaccines will not accelerate global production, instead it will take us off track in the ongoing and successful efforts to license and scale global production of vaccines that individuals can be confident are safe and effective.

Not only are companies like Instacart, Postmates, and Uber delivering food and groceries to those in isolation, they\u2019re also stepping up to donate meals and rides to workers on the frontlines and granting funds to those in need.","The company has also been posting some big acts of kindness on social media: Postmates teamed up with Jimmy Kimmel and Jennifer Aniston to surprise a COVID-19 positive nurse with a $10,000 Postmates gift card, and partnered with Steve Aoki\u2019s Pizzaoki to deliver pizza to nurses on the frontlines in California.","Here\u2019s a look at how six gig economy companies are going far beyond rides and deliveries to support Americans during the pandemic.","While Uber\u2019s ridership is down, that hasn\u2019t stopped the company from stepping up in other ways to assist in stopping the spread of COVID-19. The rideshare company pledged $10 million in free rides and food to healthcare workers, seniors, and people in need. Uber Eats waived the delivery fee for more than 100,000 restaurants across U.S. and Canada, is encouraging non-contact delivery, and its customers can now donate to their favorite restaurants through the app when they order food.","Postmates, a company known for delivering snacks, food and essentials, launched the Postmates Fleet Relief Fund in March to help its fleet of couriers cover medical expenses related to COVID-19. Non-contact deliveries have also been implemented allowing for social distancing between our customers and Postmates. Postmates is also piloting a program in the San Francisco Bay Area for small businesses to more easily use their platform by temporarily waiving commission fees.","To further help all workers, Uber partnered with the National Restaurant Association to create the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund, which will give grants to restaurant industry employees who have been impacted by COVID-19.","In addition to working with government officials to ensure restaurants can keep their kitchens open for take-out and delivery through the crisis, Grubhub is giving proceeds from its Donate the Change program (diners can round up the change from their order to go toward charitable organizations) to support restaurants and drivers impacted by the COVID-19.","Although they\u2019ve faced a similar drop in ridership, Lyft is focusing on activating several programs to serve communities. LyftUp, an initiative which typically brings transportation access to people in need, will work with public health entities and community organizations to donate free rides to those with essential transportation needs during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013especially families and children, low-income seniors, and doctors and nurses.","\u201cWe are disappointed to see the administration withdraw a balanced rule that was well-grounded in the law and provided certainty to workers and businesses about worker classification.  We hope that the administration does not pursue new regulations that would limit earning opportunities for independent workers and small businesses. Such policies will slow economic growth, job creation, and earnings as we emerge from the pandemic.\u201d","Jennie Bradley Lichter, deputy assistant to the president, White House Domestic Policy Council, stated that the White House is coordinating the federal government\u2019s response to anti-human trafficking initiatives. She said children are especially at risk for commercial sex trafficking during COVID-19 due to online exploitation, and that the departments of Justice and Health and Human Services held listening sessions among stakeholders to raise awareness.","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) provided much-needed peace of mind and support for the more than 160 million Americans that benefit from its robust, flexible, and affordable health coverage. The significant retention of employer-sponsored coverage during the pandemic further proves its value to individuals and families; as employment dropped over the course of the past year (at one point to 20%), the number of people with employer-sponsored insurance only incrementally fell by only 1% or 2%. It is particularly ironic that after such affirming statistics, some still support shifting individuals into Medicare or a public option. The US Chamber of Commerce knows the value of this coverage to employees, families and communities and we urge policymakers to strengthen, rather than destabilize, ESI.","The U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on January 21 released its annual union membership report for 2021.

Moreover, businesses across all sectors benefit from broadband access to support e-commerce applications and operational efficiencies such as the Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d). Broadband access is also important for the use of online productivity tools, and of course, to businesses whose business model relies on consumer access to broadband. Moreover, the economic implications are substantial; IoT is expected to provide a total economic impact of $14.4 trillion by 2025. The digital economy already provides $2 trillion in annual value to the U.S. economy. Consequently, it would not be an understatement to say that the benefits of internet access are broad-based and impact nearly every individual and business. Considering that the appropriations process is intended to address broad societal objectives, such as broadband, it is the only viable solution that recognizes the realities in today\u2019s communications marketplace.","Third, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in addition to the IIJA, Congress has established and strengthened numerous broadband-related programs through legislation including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, and the American Rescue Plan. These broadband programs were all financed through general appropriations. This indicates that Congress is able, and readily willing, to finance broadband programs through the appropriations process. Moreover, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress established and funded a number of broadband programs across the federal government. Examples include the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Broadband ReConnect Program and the Commission\u2019s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.","\u201cHaving survived the pandemic, now small business owners are being hit with surging inflation. It\u2019s limiting their purchasing power and forcing small businesses to raise their own prices and absorb higher costs within already thin margins,\u201d said Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe need policymakers to pursue policies that will reduce inflationary pressures, including addressing the worker shortage crisis, expanding trade, and reducing tariffs.\u201d","In fact, nearly three in ten (29%) are very concerned about rising interest rates.

It is abundantly clear that wait times at airports are dramatically impacting travel and tourism, and Congress should do all it can in working with the TSA to develop effective staffing models and adopt emerging technology for risk-based security strategies to minimize congestion. The Chamber supports $7.6 billion in funding for TSA.","We appreciate the delay of minimum contributions until 2021 and the temporary relaxation of benefit restriction status in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which helped plan sponsors navigate 2020. These provisions were a necessary first step, but as the pandemic continues, more action is needed.  Specifically, we support the provisions in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act of 2020 that provide a workable solution for single-employer plan sponsors through stabilizing interest rates and allowing for a longer period to amortize losses.[1]","Plan sponsors need help from Congress. The provisions in the HEROES Act to smooth pension contributions and provide for extended pension amortization will provide flexibility for single-employer defined benefit plan sponsors and blunt the impact of COVID-19 on these businesses and their workers who depend on a secure pension for a stable retirement.","Employers who sponsor single-employer defined benefit plans are experiencing an unexpected financial strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, according to a recent MetLife survey of defined benefit plan sponsors, 92 percent of plan sponsors have been broadly impacted by COVID-19, and nearly 50 percent have been forced to reprioritize or redeploy resources/staff internally as a result of the crisis. Over 40 percent have borrowed money, prioritized their cash and liquidity needs, or participated in the Paycheck Protection Program.  Unfortunately, the survey found that 25 percent of plan sponsors have conducted furloughs or layoffs, and 10 percent have filed, or are considering filing, for bankruptcy or have permanently closed some operations.","Employers are committed to their defined benefit plans. These are long-term obligations that can be funded over time and providing this short-term relief to plan sponsors will not impact the amount or timing of benefits to retirees.  As such, we urge Congress to include single-employer pension relief in any upcoming year-end or COVID-19 stimulus legislation. Targeted pension relief will allow businesses to provide for their employees as they return to work and in the future, while still protecting vital retirement benefits. In addition, pension smoothing and amortization can be enacted without disruption to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The PBGC\u2019s single employer program is robust with a sizeable surplus and strengthening employers\u2019 ability to remain in that program further supports the PBGC.[6]","We strongly support a robust defense industrial base and flexibility for federal contractors to provide the goods and services that the Department of Defense needs. Chamber members represent nearly all the federal contracting supply chain, from the smallest components to the largest weapon systems for the Department of Defense. The Chamber commends inclusion of section 802, which would provide the Department of Defense the statutory flexibility to reimburse its contractor workforce for unforeseen facility closures during a declared pandemic related emergency. This unique authority would expand section 3610 of the CARES Act (P. L. 116-136), which was essential in ensuring the resiliency of the defense industrial base and provided for the delivery of mission critical military equipment and services.","As we enter the third pandemic year, the one word that could sum up this phase of the 2022 midterm cycle is uncertainty. Digital ad restrictions, changes to voting laws, online privacy concerns, the direction of the pandemic and its impact on face-to-face campaigning and ad production are things that are giving consultants pause. \xa0But who wants to talk about that during a client pitch?\xa0A range of consultants, from different sectors of the industry, had these predictions for the year ahead:","The Chamber shares the strong desire to relieve supply-chain bottlenecks. A critical first step is appropriately diagnosing the problem, which undoubtedly includes COVID-19 related disruptions and abrupt shifts in consumption away from services and into goods, resulting in increased demand for the shipping of globally traded goods. We appreciate the administration\u2019s efforts to bring together various industry players to address these challenges and the new opportunities to upgrade our ports as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Yet, we strongly caution against rash changes to existing law, especially when the need for and consequences for such changes is unknown.","\u201cDuring President Biden\u2019s trip to Brussels last week, the United States and European Union agreed to establish a task force to work toward safely resuming transatlantic travel.

Although firms who choose to use the voluntary exemption have been working diligently to be compliant by that date, a substantial portion will need, or greatly benefit from, an extension to manage the new compliance requirements from PTE 2020-02 while they continue to respond to the pandemic. In particular, in the second half of 2021, some firms are simultaneously under pressure to navigate a safe and efficient return to working in their offices while also complying with PTE 2020-02, which requires significant staff training and updates to systems, processes, and procedures. More specifically, while many organizations had planned for a return to office this Fall, the rapidly developing concerns related to the Delta variant of Covid-19, and changing CDC guidance, presents new challenges to established return plans and has the potential to strain organizational resources.","America is where innovation thrives, and cutting-edge medicine is no exception.

While you may be familiar with mRNA for its use in COVID-19 vaccines, researchers have been studying how to unleash the power of mRNA for decades to treat a variety of diseases including autoimmune diseases, respiratory viruses, and cancer.","The urgent problem is the multiemployer pension system, and members of Congress are having a hard time getting to yes, even though most Americans surveyed think Congress should act. Without congressional action, the multiemployer pension system is in grave danger of collapse, and such a failure would have a ripple effect across the country. The system was already in trouble before COVID-19, and now resolving the crisis is even more urgent because revenue coming into the plans has plummeted while benefits must still be paid.","Multiemployer plans were established decades ago mainly to cover workers at small businesses or who changed jobs frequently because of their industry \u2013 think construction workers, grocery workers, or bakers \u2013 in fact, many of those who are working through the COVID-19 pandemic. Having many employers pay into one fund reduced expenses, helped small businesses offer benefits, and provided workers a portable retirement. Although these plans cover unionized workers, these plans are not union plans\u2014they are jointly managed by employers and unions.","Suppose you were a member of Congress eager to rebuild the economy and you faced the following dilemma: if you refuse to compromise, more than 1.5 million retirees would lose their pensions, millions of current workers will never see the benefits they paid for, hundreds of employers would go bankrupt, and a system that annually supports over half a million jobs and generates $14.7 billion in overall tax revenue would falter. And, to top it off, many small businesses that fought to survive the pandemic would fail.","These plans have now been hit with a third \u201conce in a lifetime event\u201d that may be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. Estimates are that the COVID-19 pandemic increased underfunding by $80 billion just since January. As a result, we are now closer than ever to seeing at least 1.5 million (if not more) individuals lose their retirement security and millions more workers have their retirement cut. At the same time, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, the federal backstop for these pensions is projected to go insolvent.","They are tracking about $39 Billion in obligations (systems are still reconciling) of which $13billion went to small businesses.

The Chamber is open to legislation that would call on the administration to develop a COTE economy plan to maintain and restore the U.S. economy in response to a significant cyber disruption.

That would be faster than the Great Recession, at around 3.5 years. It took 6 years, from January 2008 to July 2014, for the labor market to recover from financial crisis.","To be sure, the BLS has been revising initial estimates of monthly job growth upwards significantly over the last few months. Part of the reason is because surveying businesses has been particularly difficult for BLS during the pandemic. It is entirely possible that the November jobs estimate could be revised upwards by a large margin.","Despite 600,000 more people entering the workforce last month, the labor participation rate still lags pre-pandemic levels. The current labor force participation rate is 1.5 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels \u2014 if we had the same participation rate as in February 2020, there would be 4.4 million more workers in the labor force.","Fourth, in response to Question 18, the Chamber recommends that NTIA consider community health needs for connectivity as an eligible use to facilitate the BEAD goals of digital equity. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of access to broadband services for health purposes, as consumers required connectivity to remain connected to their healthcare professionals and engaged in their healthcare (22). Additionally, many home digital health products offered today work most effectively with a sufficient and sustained internet connection (23). Providing these services not only requires robust broadband infrastructure, but also programs that enable consistent, affordable access for vulnerable communities. Improved broadband access is a key part of ensuring digital health equity and inclusion.","Second, in response to Question 12, the Chamber expresses strong concerns about requirements contained in the IIJA that would subject broadband to Buy America requirements (17). Artificial barriers to broadband deployment, including domestic content requirements, will significantly hinder IIJA\u2019s stated objectives of closing the digital divide and providing consumers access to high-speed broadband (18). The present workforce and supply chain challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates this concern, directly impacting the expeditious deployment of broadband infrastructure (19). NTIA should recognize the substantial challenges of applying domestic content requirements to broadband, considering much of the broadband equipment necessary to build broadband networks is not American-made (20). The Chamber recommends that NTIA, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, collaborate with affected stakeholders to address any consequences resulting from imposing domestic content restrictions.","Prior to COVID, the Index was similarly low. It dipped below 1 in August and October of 2019. It was 1.0 in February 2020. But the circumstances in the labor market were remarkably different back then. There were about 7 million openings and available workers then. Today there are much more of each \u2013 10.9 million openings and more than 9.9 million workers available. Prior to COVID, the Index was going to be hard to lower much further because of skills and location mismatches between jobs and workers. Those issues still exist, but they are not the abiding problem right now, which is that available workers are hesitant to take the overwhelming abundance of available jobs.","Congress recognized early on that states would need assistance in financing UI. First, Congress waived the accrual of interest on UI trust fund loans through September 6, 2021. States and employers continue to struggle with labor shortages, increasing the difficulty of generating UI tax revenues. To counter this obstacle, the Chamber calls on Congress to support the reinstatement of the interest waiver which will allow states to address outstanding loans and interest payments without incurring more debt. Second, Congress appropriated $350 billion in State & Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) as part of ARPA for states to respond to the public health emergency. The Chamber urges states to use the SLFRF funds towards outstanding loans or accrued interest, or to replenish the state\u2019s UI trust fund to pre-pandemic levels. States must be aware that per Treasury\u2019s final rule, changes to a state\u2019s maximum benefit entitlement are prohibited if SLFRF funds are used towards outstanding loans or interest payments.","Just before Covid made its first appearance in the U.S., thirty-one states had a solvent, healthy UI trust fund. This meant that each state built up enough of a reserve to pay UI benefits to a projected number of eligible claimants during a recessionary period without having to borrow money from the federal government. Despite preparations, most states\u2019 trust funds were unable to support the extraordinary number of UI claimants ushered in by the Pandemic. At the height of the Pandemic, 23 states borrowed money from the federal government to pay regular UI benefits. Most of these states were able to repay their loans and replenish their trust funds. Nine states, however, still collectively owe more than $40 billion today. Additionally, interest payments on the loans are due September 30 of this year. That bill is currently more than $330 million and will continue to grow.","The Biden Administration\u2019s Path out of the Pandemic Plan announced last summer mandated, and directed various agencies, to require vaccinations for four specific groups: Federal employees, employees of federal contractors, employees of companies with at least 100 employees, and employees of healthcare providers receiving funds from Medicare or Medicaid.","Intellectual Property Drives Economic Prosperity as World Emerges from Pandemic, New Report Shows","Despite inventory challenges amid supply chain bottlenecks from the global pandemic, new data forecasts online holiday shopping to reach a record $207 billion in 2021, an increase of 10% from last year. Unfortunately, this online shopping boom could also usher in a rise in counterfeit and fake goods populating ecommerce platforms.","\u201cAmerica\u2019s pharmaceutical companies created safe, effective COVID vaccines in record time because of years of investments in research. The price controls proposed by the Biden administration are nothing more than a tax on the research investments that have made break-throughs, like the COVID vaccines, possible.

As of January 2022, there were nearly 330 voluntary partnerships and collaborations among manufacturers facilitating the production of billions of doses of vaccines, and over 110 voluntary partnerships facilitating production of therapeutics, all supported by the contractual licensing of IP rights.","In 2021, COVID-19 continued to dominate our lives, jeopardize our health, and threaten to undermine our fragile economic recovery. While uncertainty around the pandemic persisted, intellectual property (IP) drove the development of innovative vaccines, therapeutics, and technologies that kept us safe, connected, and productive throughout the pandemic.","IP-intensive goods and services were critical to the global response to COVID-19.","Now in its tenth edition, the International IP Index benchmarks the IP framework in 55 global economies across 50 unique indicators. In 2021, Ghana and Honduras were added to the Index. The global pandemic clearly illustrated that innovation and creativity occur in an ecosystem, and the Index sheds light on the health of that ecosystem in global markets.","Despite the critical role IP has played in response to the pandemic, some members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have continued to push a proposal to \u201cwaive\u201d international IP commitments","The vaccines, therapeutics, and technologies that have led the global community through the pandemic are the fruit of a pre-existing innovation ecosystem that relies on IP rights to enable allocation of resources, formation of partnerships, and transfer of technology on commercial terms.","Early 2022 will likely see strong economic conditions continue, although the rise in cases because of Omicron complicates projections at this time. Nevertheless, even with the pandemic surging, inflation concerns, supply chain bottlenecks, and worker shortages, growth should remain strong in 2022. We are estimating over 4% growth for the year.","Despite the overall encouraging outlook right now, not all industries are faring the same, some are doing much better, and others are still struggling to rebound from COVID-19.","\u201cAccredited chambers are organizations that hold themselves to the highest industry standards.  They are recognized for their work to create and expand business opportunities in their communities\u201d said Raymond P. Towle, IOM, CAE, U.S. Chamber vice president of Federation Relations and Institute for Organization Management. \u201cThroughout the pandemic, these chambers continue to lead while maintaining transparent governance practices, sound financial controls, safe work environments, value in programming and effective communications.  They are commended for this great accomplishment.\u201d","Tech companies and some segments of the retail industry, for example, thrived as their products or services directly supported work, education, health, or simply daily life in a pandemic. Their successes kept the stock market hovering around all-time highs and helped drive the strongest growth rate on record in the third quarter of 2020.","Looking back to last fall, approximately six months into COVID-19, the Chamber noticed a trend that would come to define our pandemic economy. Our nation was experiencing a K-Shaped Recovery, where some businesses and industries experienced a sharp rebound from the initial economic shocks of the pandemic, while others remained in freefall.","Following the Great Recession, for example, our economy took more than three years to recover. Alternatively, we are currently on track to return to our pre-pandemic levels in less than half that time.","As the tragic COVID-19 wave in India continues to devastate the nation, it should give us all a sense of caution about the challenges yet ahead in fully emerging from this crisis. And it should serve a reminder that this is a global pandemic\u2014one that will not be over until it is defeated in every corner of the world.","The potential threats looming are more than just a resurgence of the pandemic, though. All of our economic gains could be equally upended by policies that would saddle job creators and slow growth at a time when they are needed most.","Consumer sentiment is at the highest level it has been since before the pandemic, and income and personal savings have risen sharply over that time. These trends and increasing vaccinations help explain why small business optimism and manufacturing sentiment is also on the rise.","This summer should mark the end of the K-Shaped Recovery and the beginning of the Great Resurgence. The disappointing April jobs report, however, shows the recovery can still be undermined by policy choices. It's crucial that we continue to gain control over the pandemic, get people back into the workforce, and that policymakers reject tax increases that would punish job creators at this critical moment. \"President Biden recently gave a national address where he rightfully celebrated our progress in supporting families, strengthening communities, and shepherding our nation through the pandemic. It\u2019s important to remember that this was possible because of the strength and resilience of the private sector aided by the federal government.","If these predictions hold true, our GDP will return to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of this year, much faster than past economic recoveries.","Private-sector innovation, led by the pharmaceutical industry and a whole-of-business effort to manufacture, mobilize, and administer vaccines at a historic pace, has brought into sight the light at the end of the tunnel of the pandemic.","All of this optimism is contingent upon our nation\u2019s commitment to fully defeating the pandemic.","Based on the U.S. Chamber\u2019s current economic predictions, our GDP will return to pre-COVID levels this quarter, and by the fourth quarter of the year the economy will exceed its pre-pandemic trajectory.","What\u2019s even more incredible, by the fourth quarter of this year our GDP is on pace to surpass the levels it was tracking before COVID-19.","Data Flows are Vital for Transatlantic Collaboration: Transatlantic data transfers enable an array of essential activities, including multi-country clinical trials for innovative medicines such as COVID-19 vaccines, cybersecurity threat information sharing, and anti-fraud and anti-money laundering efforts.","The Court\u2019s ruling also raised questions about standard contractual clauses, essentially jeopardizing the legal tool used by 90% of companies to transfer data out of Europe. The result: companies are beginning to be caught in the crossfire of investigations and legal actions injecting uncertainty around cross-border data transfers. Many firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, are already enduring market access disruptions due to the global pandemic and now face further risks to their transatlantic business operations.","Although the FCC has accumulated an impressive resume of successes despite the challenges of COVID-19 and inheriting declining investment 2016, at least 18 million Americans without broadband is still too much.

As leading industry associations, aviation stakeholders, and labor unions, we all have significant concerns pertaining to the continued delay of the remote identification rulemaking and the adverse implications of that delay on the safety and security of airspace as well as on the future of the unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) industry. We urge the Administration to convene key federal agency stakeholders including the FAA, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice to collaborate on publishing a rule on remote identification without further delay.","In addition to addressing the safety and security risks, remote identification will unlock the benefits of advanced UAS operations that will allow for the United States to lead in developing innovative UAS applications such as delivery, surveying, filmmaking, and search and rescue. For example, the final rule on \u201cOperation of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Over People\u201d is contingent upon a final action on remote identification. Failure to expeditiously address remote identification curtails these expanded operations, hinders U.S. global competitiveness, and increases the likelihood that innovation will move overseas.","Increased UAS integration is expected to bring numerous benefits to consumers and support public safety. However, careless and criminal use of UAS can pose significant risks to manned aircraft operations, interfere with emergency and law enforcement operations, and endanger critical infrastructure. Full implementation of remote identification will provide the capability to identify friend and foe, strengthen privacy protections, and importantly underlies the other features essential for the safe integration of UAS \u2013 counter-drone systems and UAS traffic management.","At the start of this year, a coalition of over 100 national and local organizations\u2014led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Bipartisan Policy Center\u2014launched the \u201cBuild by the Fourth of July\u201d coalition to urge Congress and the Biden administration to craft and pass a fiscally and environmentally responsible infrastructure package by the Fourth of July, 2021.","However, Congress is considering new antitrust legislation which, perversely, would weaken leading U.S. technology companies by crafting special purpose regulations under the guise of antitrust to prohibit those firms from engaging in business conduct that is widely acceptable when engaged in by rival competitors.","Two areas of technological innovation prioritized by C_TEC are unmanned aircraft systems (\u201cUAS\u201d) and automated vehicles (\u201cAVs\u201d).

Many entities across a broad spectrum of economic sectors are depending on the establishment of such voluntary offset markets to meet their ambitious climate commitments. Promoting responsible resource management and nature-based climate solutions through financial incentives for voluntary conservation and sustainable land-use practices is a win-win policy that will benefit American agriculture, the associated supply chains, the broader business community, and the environment.","We need a regulatory framework that supports the private-sector led innovation needed to address challenges such as climate change\u2014which cannot and will not be solved without the ingenuity and investment of American business, working in cooperation with global partners.","This moment in time requires leadership, and it requires thinking about our energy policy not in terms of a binary choice between fossil fuel production and climate change mitigation but rather in the context of energy security and the energy transition.\u202fEscalating prices and the current global conflict underscore the urgency to do both, and we think our nation can rise to the challenge and meet our imperative.","Throughout our history, America has answered the call when the world needs us. \xa0Such a moment is once again upon us. \xa0With vast energy resources and technological know-how, our nation is uniquely positioned to meet the world\u2019s growing demand for affordable, reliable energy. \xa0At the same time, we must remain focused on the urgent challenge of climate change by developing and deploying the technologies needed to reduce emissions and decarbonize our economy. \xa0Fortunately, we can accomplish both imperatives by leveraging the power of the U.S. business community in partnership with our government.","The invasion of Ukraine also shows why we must remain committed to an ambitious energy transition \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible at the pace of innovation. This effort also requires deliberate long-term planning and a government/business partnership. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry has pointed out that half of the technologies needed to address the global climate challenge are not yet commercially available or have yet to be invented. Whether in renewables, batteries, hydrogen, advanced nuclear, or carbon capture and removal, there is enormous opportunity to accelerate progress through investments in technology and innovation. With Congress having enacted the Energy Act of 2020 and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law late last year providing well more than $100 billion in new investments, we have a strong foundation to build upon.","Understandably, most Americans do not pay attention to energy policy until prices start rising like they began doing last year.\u202f Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting tough sanctions imposed by the international community highlights the world\u2019s dependence on reliable supplies of energy to support the entire global economy. Oil and natural gas are the primary sources of that energy, and the Department of Energy forecasts they will remain the most-consumed sources of energy in the U.S. through at least 2050. Just as greater use of natural gas enabled the U.S. to lead the world in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions since 2005, we know it can do the same for developing economies as it avoids the use of higher emitting fuels.","(C)\xa0\xa0 The projected return of the portfolio relative to the funding objectives of the plan, which may often require an evaluation of the economic effects of climate change and other environmental, social, or governance factors on the particular investment or investment course of action (emphasis added).","In the alternative, if the DOL does not delete this subclause, it should modify it to provide that \u201cand, depending on the facts and circumstances and the actual investment, may or may not require an evaluation of the economic effects of climate change and other environmental, social, or governance factors on the particular investment or investment course of action.\u201d","With respect to the assessment of the projected return in subclause (b)(2)(ii)(C), delete the clause \u201cwhich may often require an evaluation of the economic effects of climate change and other environmental, social, or governance factors on the particular","The 2020 Regulation, including paragraph (e) that relates to proxy voting, was codified at 29 C.F.R.

Because supply side policies that restrict domestic production do not reduce global energy demand, they do not lead to lower emissions. Instead, they simply shift production to foreign countries that typically have lower environmental standards. This creates the counterintuitive reality of production restrictions leading to higher emissions.","Recently released data from the International Energy Agency\u2019s Global Methane Tracker supports this conclusion. As shown in the chart below, IEA estimates that the methane intensity of oil and gas production in Russia is 30 percent higher than in the United States.

Perhaps the most striking example is H.R. 1\u2019s sweeping regulation of so-called \u201ccampaign-related disbursements,\u201d which captures a brand-new category of communications that \u201cpromote,\u201d \u201cattack,\u201d \u201csupport,\u201d or \u201coppose\u201d a candidate or elected official (\u201cPASO communications\u201d). Unlike existing campaign finance law, which regulates speech that either expressly advocates a candidate\u2019s election or defeat or that mentions a candidate in relatively close temporal proximity to an election, the vague and overly broad new definition of PASO communications applies year-round and threatens to consume any legislative advocacy that dares mention an elected official. The penalties imposed by H.R. 1 for engaging in PASO communications are severe \u2013 a group that spends more than an aggregate of $10,000 on such communications over a two-year election cycle must, among other things, file reports publicly disclosing all of its donors who have given it more than $10,000 during the election cycle. As in previous versions of the DISCLOSE Act, the $10,000 donor threshold appears designed to target business organizations while largely sparing labor organizations from disclosure of their funding sources, which are typically union dues that are far less than $10,000.","U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, Ill-Suited: Private Rights of Action and Privacy Claims at 14 (July 2019) available athttps://instituteforlegalreform.com/wp\u2013content/uploads/media/Private_Rights_of_Action__Ill_Suited_Paper.pdf.","See California Privacy Rights Act at Section 17 (https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/ca_privacy_rights_act_2020_ballot_initiative.pdf).","First, every American and business benefits from the internet and broadband deployment. When the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted only 20 million American adults had internet access and spent less than 30 minutes a day, onaverage, on the web (15). Today, 93% of Americans use the internet and spend nearly 8 hours a day consuming digital media (16). Similarly, the internet is also central to conducting business whether that be through new business models or increased efficiency at work. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the internet contributed $2.45 trillion to the U.S. economy and supported 17 million jobs (17). Notably, the impact of the internet provides substantial benefits for specific sectors such as healthcare for telehealth, retail for e-commerce, and entertainment for internet streaming. Moreover, internet connectivity is essential for purposes such as teleworking, payments, email, and online productivity tools.","Fourth and finally, any proposed change should enable, and not inhibit, the growth of the internet economy, which encompasses applications, business models, and sectors across the entire internet ecosystem. The internet economy is essential to continued U.S. global competitiveness and to providing critical services and products to consumers. The Department of Commerce estimates that the output of the U.S. digital economy exceeded $2 trillion in 2019, a $700 billion increase from 2010 (28). In fact, the internet economy grew seven times faster than the overall U.S. economy over the last four years (29). The number of jobs supported by internet related activities is estimated at 3 million in the U.S. alone (30). Many of these gains can be attributed to new business models and innovations, ranging from social media, e-commerce, the gig economy, and business to business providers.","\u201cHave you or a loved one been hurt?

If a company settles an OSHA violation noted during an inspection but files a notification for modification of abatement, is that deemed a reportable event under the proposed AGAR clause? If the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (that enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act) declines to proceed with a discrimination charge but the employee has not acted on their Notice of Right to Sue, would that be considered adjudicated? Or what is the status if a charge is settled or mediated before any agency determination? Similarly, what level of adjudication triggers reporting of an unfair labor practice charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board? ULPs are a frequent pressure tactic of unions when seeking to unionize a company or during contract negotiations. Furthermore, every statute cited in the list of reportable labor law violations has its own investigation, enforcement and remedial provision to be enforced by a government agency or a private allegedly aggrieved individual or party. Thus, there is no void left to be filled by superimposing a non-related procurement obligation on top of an already long-standing and legally defined enforcement process for labor and employment laws dating back to the 1930\u2019s.

A recent study found that two-thirds of beneficiaries earn more on unemployment than they made while working. One-fifth earn at least double what they earned working, and the median replacement rate is 134%. The Congressional Budget Office has said that if this additional funding is extended for another six months, then five out of six beneficiaries would receive more from unemployment than what they could expect to earn working. Compensating someone more for not working than they can earn working discourages work, makes it harder for employers to bring back furloughed employees, and ultimately holds back economic recovery.","As Congress considers these ideas, it should create a framework that balances the need to protect consumers with the principles of fair notice, due process, and proportionality.\xa0 On one hand, the FTC should have the authority, and efficient available processes, to obtain remedial relief to compensate consumers who are harmed by genuine misconduct.\xa0 Disgorgement and restitution are examples of equitable relief that can make consumers whole for actual injuries.\xa0 On the other hand, Congress must ensure that any additional penalties, such as civil fines, are limited to clear instances of misconduct where defendants have had fair notice that their conduct could incur stiffer penalties \u2013 in other words, where a defendant violated an established rule, an existing court order, or an order from the FTC.","The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces a broad range of laws designed to protect consumers and competition.\xa0 To enforce these laws, the FTC has an array of tools at its disposal, from holding hearings and issuing white papers to seeking injunctive relief and monetary penalties.\xa0 Recently, the scope of the FTC\u2019s remedial authority has come under significant scrutiny from both the courts and Congress.\xa0 In early 2021, rejecting years of agency practice, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the FTC lacked the statutory authority to seek monetary penalties for certain violations of consumer protection laws, without first going through deliberative internal administrative processes.","American Chemistry CouncilAssociation of Global AutomakersHere For AmericaBSA | The Software AllianceBusiness RoundtableCoalition of Services IndustriesComputer & Communications Industry AssociationCompTIACTIAInformation Technology Industry CouncilInternet AssociationIPCMotor & Equipment Manufacturers AssociationNational Association of ManufacturersNational Electrical Manufacturers AssociationNational Foreign Trade CouncilNational Retail FederationNCTA \u2013 The Internet & Television AssociationOrganization for International InvestmentSatellite Industry AssociationSecurity Industry AssociationSEMISemiconductor Industry AssociationTechNetTelecommunications Industry AssociationUS-China Business CouncilU.S. Chamber of CommerceUnited States Council for International BusinessUSTelecom - The Broadband Association","Rather than blame the business community, policymakers should explore other avenues to encourage competition and lower prices for consumers.

Specifically, we support the provisions in the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES) Act of 2020 that provide a workable solution for single-employer plan sponsors through stabilizing interest rates and allowing for a longer period to amortize losses.[1]","With a new Democratic majority in place, observers of labor policy generally expect the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to adopt an aggressive stance when it comes to enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). For employers that the Board deems to have violated that law, one element of that stance will likely include remedial orders that include dubious requirements, such as mandating access to the employer\u2019s property or requiring the employer to read aloud a Board notice.","With regard to the order requiring union access to Sysco\u2019s facilities, the court noted that the union had collected authorization cards from almost 100 out of 162 employees and said that \u201cneither the General Counsel nor the Union has made any showing that Sysco prevented the [union] from reaching Sysco's employees.\u201d Thus, it concluded that  \u201c[o]rdering access to a company's facilities and employees \u2018cannot be justified as a remedial measure\u2019 unless it is \u2018necessary to offset the direct consequences or effects of an employer's unlawful conduct,\u2019\u201d which was not the case here.","While additional regulation by the DOL is not necessary, it may, however, be helpful for the DOL to provide technical clarity on specific issues \u2013 for instance including examples pursuant to FAQ 18 of how insurance companies can use intermediaries to comply with PTE 2020-02.","While it is encouraging that the E.O. states that, \u201cTraining employees to create an inclusive workplace is appropriate and beneficial,\u201d we fear that the E.O. will diminish the amount of training that takes place.\xa0 The E.O. seeks to identify specific concepts that would be prohibited, but the description of these concepts leaves considerable ambiguity as to what content would not be permitted in diversity and inclusiveness (D&I) training.\xa0 Furthermore, there is a great deal of subjectivity around how certain content would be perceived by different individuals. \xa0For example, the definition of \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d creates many gray areas and will likely result in multiple different interpretations. Because the ultimate threat of debarment is a possible consequence, we have heard from some companies that they are suspending all D&I training. \xa0This outcome is contrary to the E.O.\u2019s stated purpose, but an understandable reaction given companies\u2019 lack of clear guidance.

Online platforms sprang to action in the early days of the invasion to combat false narratives and prevent the Russian weaponization of social media.

In 2021, about 37% of organizations globally reported that they were hit by a ransomware attack, according to IDC's\xa02021 Ransomware Study. That number, according to most experts, will continue growing in 2022.","Wrong. Businesses of all sizes are targets of ransomware attacks. Malicious actors have targeted small and large businesses alike, and they can be highly specific in whom they target. All kinds of companies are on the receiving end of phishing campaigns, where emails or text messages go out with malicious links. Identifying dangerous emails is becoming more and more difficult as cybercriminals become more sophisticated. A bad actor might feel like they can secure a larger payday from a bigger target, but every company is at risk.","While victim organizations are forced to make difficult business decisions to pay a ransom, there are legal and regulatory obligations that organizations must be aware of. The U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued an\xa0updated advisory\xa0to highlight the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments to specially designated nationals and proactive steps businesses can take to mitigate such risks. Ransomware victims may consider engaging an outside counsel before and during a ransomware event to better understand the legal and regulatory risks.","Ransomware is a type of cyberattack that couples unauthorized access to a company's systems and networks with a demand for payment. Typically, data or systems are locked through encryption of a victim's files, with businesses unable to recover data and get systems running again until they pay a ransom.","At present, there is not enough data on the number of attacks and the number of payments made to answer this question with a good deal of fidelity. But we do know that the absolute numbers are large and growing. Victims of ransomware attacks will need to make the difficult business decision as to whether it makes sense to pay the ransom against the operational, financial, and customer-related impacts of being shut down. The alternative to not paying is to rely solely on backup data or backup systems that are not affected by the breach, which is why it's important to prepare in advance for ransomware attacks. On top of this, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has become more common. Cybercriminals like Darkside and REvil employ customer service teams to help victims make ransomware payments, navigate malware removal, and even negotiate the payment amount.","Traditional cyberattacks are used to steal information, conduct espionage, and cause destruction and disruption. Cyberattacks historically have included the theft of passwords, personal information, trade secrets, and other intellectual property; destruction of servers; and overloading systems with traffic. But ransomware is different in that data or systems are held hostage with payment demanded.","Ransomware threat actors have moved to double, triple, and quadruple extortion attacks for a few reasons. First, there's a chance a victim will pay with each level of extortion. Secondly, organizations' cyber resilience has improved. Data backups are much more commonplace than they were 10 years ago. Bad actors may not be able to do much if a victim has a backup, but the victim may pay if threatened with their data being released to the public.","Double extortion involves data exfiltration from a victim's network. This means the data has been taken by the bad actors and could potentially be released to the public, destroyed, sold, or held. Triple and quadruple ransomware extortion attacks are also on the rise, and those involve either re-victimization or victimization of customers and business partners.","The bad actors that develop and use ransomware continue to learn and evolve over time. One way they have done this is by upping the pressure on a victim organization to pay a ransom in a certain amount of time. Let's call that a single extortion attack. Malicious malware software is injected, data is encrypted, and a demand is made.","Update the definition of organized retail crime and increase criminal penalties:\xa0States should act to define the crime of \u201corganized retail theft\u201d in criminal law to specify those thefts involving two or more participants and an intention of resale and include increased penalties for those specific violations.","Congress should pass legislation to stop the sale of stolen goods on online marketplaces:\xa0The bipartisan H.R. 5502, \u201cIntegrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for (INFORM) Consumers Act,\u201d would increase transparency and identity verification of high-volume third-party sellers in online retail marketplaces while protecting the privacy of small sellers and establishing a uniform federal standard that would provide certainty and consistency for the business community.

In addition to hotel workers, educating guests to understand and recognize common indicators and empowering them to know how to report potential trafficking situations is another way we can be part of the solution.","We are proud to share that, as of the end of January, the company has successfully trained 500,000 hotel workers to spot the signs of human trafficking on property, and how to respond if they come across suspicious activity.","We need a tough stance on cyber threats, working with allied partners when possible and unilaterally when necessary to deter and punish criminals and their state-sponsors.","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes H.R. 4777, the \u201cNondebtor Release Prohibition Act,\u201d which would upend the American bankruptcy system, which decades of experience have demonstrated to be one of the fairest means available to resolve complex mass tort litigation while protecting the interests of victims.\xa0 H.R. 4777 would needlessly complicate the bankruptcy system, make it more difficult for victims to obtain appropriate compensation in a timely manner, and put in place roadblocks to resolving numerous complex litigation matters.","The premise behind H.R. 4777 is flawed in multiple ways. \xa0For example, there is no compelling evidence that current law, which requires judges to review the facts and circumstances of proposed third party litigation releases, has been abused to the detriment of victims.\xa0 On the contrary, the House Judiciary Committee received powerful testimony in previous Congresses that plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys generate questionable claims to influence active bankruptcies and, later, extract undeserved payouts from court-approved trust funds. \xa0H.R. 4777 would, instead, feed into this type of behavior by providing additional leverage to the trial bar in these types of bankruptcies.","Rather than attacking corporations for pursuing a path that provides both substantial support for victims and certainty to employees, shareholders, and the communities that these businesses support, Congress should wholistically examine the bankruptcy system, explore reforms that would improve outcomes for claimants, and increase transparency instead of disproportionately advantaging the trial bar as H.R. 4777 does.\xa0 Accordingly, we oppose H.R. 4777 and urge the members of the Committee to do the same.","Complex mass tort bankruptcies often involve third parties, including debtor companies\u2019 predecessors and successors in interest, suppliers, users, and corporate affiliates.\xa0 Limiting the ability of courts and companies to address litigation issues globally would harm legitimate claimants by depriving them of resources and forcing them into litigation.\xa0 Compensation systems established through bankruptcy allow claimants to receive timely payments rather than having to pursue lengthy litigation against multiple defendants. \xa0Eliminating litigation, and its extraordinary costs and inefficiencies, also maximizes the funds available to victims.","Aviation is rife with disruptive innovations. For example, Embraer is already on its fourth generation application of fly-by-wire technology.

Unfortunately, as more and more creative works are accessible online, more bad actors steal and share copyrighted creative works illegally and maliciously. Fortunately, governments are fighting back. Economies at every level of development - from the US, UK, and Sweden to India, Singapore, and Russia - have utilized injunctive-style relief to disable access to copyright-infringing content online and are already seeing positive results. For example, in Sweden, survey results show that the number of respondents accessing copyright-infringing content online fell from 21 percent to 14 percent following the implementation of injunctive-style relief measures.","Counter Human Trafficking Compliance Solutions (CHTCS) is a global compliance and advisory company that provides on-site assessments, improvement plans, training, research, and supply chain transparency required for corporations to combat human trafficking, forced labor, and modern slavery.","Against this backdrop, it is all the more bewildering that earlier this year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) seemed to suggest some surprise that financial service providers charge for the products they provide to consumers.

Specifically, Congress must pass a short and simple bill that grants Kazakhstan PNTR status and graduates the country from the requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. This measure was devised to press the Soviet Union to allow the emigration of Soviet Jews, prisoners of conscience, and victims of religious persecution. For decades, U.S. presidents of both parties have issued annual certifications of Kazakhstan\u2019s full compliance of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.","Ensure compliance is supportive, not punitive. A final bill must create a compliance regime that treats cyberattack victims as victims. A reporting program needs to encourage cooperation and strengthen trust between the public and private sectors.

Cyber incident response service providers, such as cybersecurity firms, law firms, and insurers, should not be required to report incidents to government that have occurred on their customers\u2019 networks unless explicitly authorized by their customers to do so on their behalf. This approach would avoid unintended outcomes like compelling cybersecurity providers to disclose clients\u2019 sensitive business information, breach contractual obligations, and dissuade businesses from employing outside experts to the detriment of businesses\u2019 cyber defenses.","Our organizations are committed to working with lawmakers and their staff on cyber incident reporting legislation to strengthen our national security and the protection and resilience of U.S. industry. We also believe that the legislation can and must address private sector concerns with forced notifications. It needs to enhance agencies\u2019 situational awareness so that government can better inform and partner with businesses that become cyberattack targets or victims.","Include robust liability protections.The legislation should establish that the act of reporting a covered incident and the contents of any report, including supplemental reporting, are protected from legal liability. Information contained in notifications should not be subject to discovery in any civil or criminal action. Reporting entities, in essence, should not be penalized after the fact for complying with a legal obligation. In addition, bill writers are urged to aggressively limit the amount of information that covered entities would be required to submit to CISA or their relevant sector regulator.","An estimated 70 million people in the U.S. have an arrest or conviction record, and over 600,000 men and women are released from jail each year.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars a year in illicit profit. All victims of trafficking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.Industry has an important role to play. Businesses cannot do this work alone. The business community needs to partner with governments and non-governmental organizations to address the scope of this problemBusinesses face an economic, legal, and reputational risk if they engage in human trafficking. The task force develops toolkits, hosts forums, and engages in advocacy work to shine a spotlight on this problem.According to the International Labor Organization, whereas 19% of victims are trafficked for commercial sex and make up a vast majority of illicit profits, incidences of forced labor are prevalent and widespread globally. To eradicate human trafficking, the task force addresses forced labor in supply chains and commercial sex trafficking.To conduct sex trafficking, traffickers rely on the transportation and hospitality sectors for moving and controlling victims, giving these sectors a critical role as the first line of defense.Regarding forced labor, repeal of the consumptive demand clause in 2016 heightened the need for businesses to be cognizant of labor risks.The financial sector also plays a role in eliminating forced labor. Since 2018, financial institutions such as banks have been required by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to identify and report suspicious activity related to human trafficking.Employers, in conjunction with social service providers, counseling firms, housing agencies, and skills-based training organizations, provide resources for human trafficking victims to heal.

It also sets forth numerous robust rights in arbitration for victims of sexual harassment, including the right to report harassment and to speak out publicly. Importantly, this bill also protects sexual assault and harassment victims\u2019 recoveries in any claims they may bring in arbitration or in court from being unreasonably reduced by attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.

Nor does it contain a carve-out that would allow labor unions to use pre-dispute arbitration to resolve their disputes while denying the use of arbitration to others. Arbitration provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court. Empirical studies demonstrate that employees in arbitration do just as well, or in many circumstances, considerably better, than in court. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the flexibility of arbitration served complainants and businesses alike well as arbitration cases proceeded on schedule, while courthouses were forced to close their doors and developed significant backlogs that still present a challenge today.","\u201cThe retail industry \u2013 already struggling from the impacts of the pandemic, labor shortages and supply chain problems \u2013 is now faced with large-scale theft and looting, much of it stemming from organized crime,\u201d said Neil Bradley, Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cRetail theft is becoming a national crisis, hurting businesses in every state and the communities they serve.

According to a survey of larger retailers by the National Retail Federation, organized retail crime cost stores an average of over $700,000 per $1 billion in sales in 2020, up more than 50% in the last five years.","The law and prosecutors must hold those who engage in organized and significant retail theft accountable: Since 2000, at least 40 states have raised the thresholds for the value of stolen goods to trigger a felony charge. In some instances, criminals are taking advantage of these increased higher thresholds to engage in repeated thefts and avoid prosecution. States should reconsider these thresholds and prosecutors should avoid adopting broad non-prosecution policies.","Update the definition of organized retail crime and increase criminal penalties:\xa0States should act to define the crime of \u201corganized retail theft\u201d in criminal law to specify those thefts involving two or more participants and an intention of resale and include increased penalties for those specific violations.","\u201cThese crimes are not victimless,\u201d the Chamber letter reads. \u201cIn addition to the growing number of thefts that turn violent, innocent consumers, employees, local communities, and business owners and shareholders bear the costs of rising retail theft.

This legislation would deter retail crime by closing off a prominent avenue by which criminals seek to profit by selling stolen goods, often to unsuspecting customers.","Facial recognition is not a new technology. Its origins stretch back to the 1960s, and the rapid improvement of the technology has unlocked numerous applications across various industries. For instance, government applications include airline passenger facilitation and criminal investigations, and commercial applications include theft prevention in the retail industry, fraud detection, and automated photo tagging. Biometric facial verification, when done properly, is much more accurate than human facial verification. For example, passport officers are, at most, 80% accurate in matching passport photos to people, while facial algorithms are about 99% accurate for most traveler galleries. Given the diverse uses of the technology, a moratorium on federal use would create uncertainty and have a chilling effect on innovation throughout the facial recognition ecosystem. Further, it would undermine the implementation of a long-standing, bipartisan congressional mandate aimed at applying one of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Report, namely, a biometrically enabled immigration exit system.","U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are undertaking several pilot programs at major airports using facial recognition technology to improve passenger facilitation and enhance aviation security. The FBI possesses a photo database to empower state and local law enforcement agencies to conduct facial recognition searches to assist in criminal investigations. The U.S. government has been a leader in advancing the technology, driving industry to constantly innovate, and setting the example internationally how to ethically and responsibly govern this technology.","Update the definition of organized retail crime and increase criminal penalties:\xa0 States should act to define the crime of \u201corganized retail theft\u201d in criminal law to specify those thefts involving two or more participants and an intention of resale and include increased penalties for those specific violations.","Congress should pass legislation to stop the sale of stolen goods on online marketplaces: The bipartisan H.R. 5502, \u201cIntegrity, Notification, and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for (INFORM) Consumers Act,\u201d would increase transparency and identity verification of high-volume third-party sellers in online retail marketplaces while protecting the privacy of small sellers and establishing a uniform federal standard that would provide certainty and consistency for the business community.

But despite their importance to the supply chain, fraudulent claims targeting truck drivers, which result in enormous legal verdicts, contribute to the costs and shortages facing the industry. This bill would address this problem by making it a federal crime to stage a vehicle collision against a commercial motor vehicle.","Human tracking is a global problem affecting millions of people each year who are illegally lured into forced labor and sexual exploitation through force, fraud, or coercion. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human tracking is second only to drug tracking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars per year in illicit profit.1 All victims of tracking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.","Businesses today are increasingly global, meaning that it is no longer a matter if a business will come into contact with human tra cking but when. It is therefore important to be prepared. In the marketplace, everyone understands the principle of supply and demand. Demand creates a market, and supply will meet demand, with unscrupulous exploiters working to fill it with an eye to the greatest profit margin for themselves. Traffickers use violence, intimidation, and manipulation as trafficking is often hidden in plain sight. Therefore, no demand = no victim = no trafficking. The business community is well positioned to be on the frontline in the fight against trafficking. From a risk management approach, anti-trafficking training should be provided in the workplace. Companies should also adopt an anti-trafficking-in-persons policy with a demand-reduction focus.

Let me be clear: IP rights help \u2013 they don\u2019t hinder \u2013 access to innovation by enabling long-term investments in technology in the first instance, and by supporting a wide range of public and private partnerships to appropriately share know-how and capabilities through IP licensing.

As a result, millions of employees who had enjoyed flexible hours and professional status were converted to non-exempt status and put on the clock. Surveys showed that many previously exempt employees valued the flexible hours and work schedules that exempt status provided. Furthermore, because the rule applied to all employers, some charitable non-profits could not afford to keep employees working the same hours and would have been forced to reduce the services they provide. The regulation was eventually struck down by a federal judge in Texas who ruled that the new threshold was so high it rendered moot the salary test for exempt status. The Trump Administration\u2019s DOL promulgated a new regulation establishing the current salary threshold of $35,568, a significant increase and a level the business community supports.

With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition.
