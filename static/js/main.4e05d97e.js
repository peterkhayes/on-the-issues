Researchers at University of Pennsylvania, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, spent over a decade conducting research on synthetic mRNA and published the findings in 2005. This foundational research inspired founders of Moderna to use mRNA for medicines and raised $2 billion on the concept before going public in 2018. Soon after the world became aware of the COVID-19 virus, Moderna researchers used the mRNA technique to create a vaccine and was one of the first drugmakers to develop a vaccine suitable for clinical trials. Operation Warp Speed, through funding appropriated by the CARES Act, provided Moderna with $2.58 billion in two grants to facilitate development of their vaccine.Likewise, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also utilized mRNA to develop a COVID19 vaccine. BioNTech similarly licensed the novel technology developed at the University of Pennsylvania to try to harness the medical potential of mRNA. At the onset of the pandemic, BioNTech partnered with Pfizer, an 171 year old biopharmaceutical company, to develop and test their mRNA vaccine candidate. While Pfizer did not receive R&D funding through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government agreed to pay $1.95 billion to purchase 100 million doses of the vaccine.Federal support for basic research is not the only public policy whose benefits are highlighted by the new vaccines. Immigrant innovators were often the tip of the spear, and the ability of firms to draw on global production networks sourcing inputs from around the globe has proven essential to the development and deployment\u2014with unprecedented speed\u2014of these novel and impressive vaccines. There are important lessons here for elected officials considering the direction of U.S. immigration, trade, and supply chain policies.Last December, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorizations for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines. The story of both vaccines illustrates how basic federal funding \u2013 for either R&D or the medicines themselves \u2013 paired with private sector expertise can lead to game-changing medical innovations in record time.","keywords":["covid","pandemic"]},{"text":"While the nation continues to grapple with the effects of COVID-19, policymakers must take the long-view and look ahead to the wide range of challenges and opportunities the country will face over the next few decades.","keywords":["covid"]},{"text":"Members of Congress, such as Representatives Diana DeGette and Fred Upton, have appropriately recognized the threat COVID-19 poses to our national research enterprise through the introduction of the Research Investment to Spark the Economy (\u201cRISE\u201d) Act, which would provide support to America\u2019s research enterprise.

The Department decided that doing so would minimize volatility in unit costs.

As of October 2021, 60% of consulates worldwide remained partially or fully closed to nonemergency nonimmigrant visa appointments, with 40% of all consulates worldwide still remaining fully closed.

Businesses fully appreciate the fact that these presidential proclamations created new requirements that increased the number of hours that consular officials needed to expend in adjudicating various types of consular applications. However, the Department provided no explanation in its NPRM as to how these proclamations factored into its formulation for its cost estimates. Presumably, these proclamations will not exist in perpetuity, and employers hope that the State Department made reasonable assumptions as to how such proclamations would impact its cost modeling. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the NPRM to show employers how these presidential proclamations, particularly the increased resources needed to comply with them, influenced how the new CoSM used by the Department helped them arrive at their proposed fee increases.

This lasted through the first few weeks of the Biden Administration, but that changed drastically when the Department of State took over the vast majority of these adjudications as the months passed.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars a year in illicit profit.

The business community needs to partner with governments and non-governmental organizations to address the scope of this problemBusinesses face an economic, legal, and reputational risk if they engage in human trafficking. The task force develops toolkits, hosts forums, and engages in advocacy work to shine a spotlight on this problem.According to the International Labor Organization, whereas 19% of victims are trafficked for commercial sex and make up a vast majority of illicit profits, incidences of forced labor are prevalent and widespread globally. To eradicate human trafficking, the task force addresses forced labor in supply chains and commercial sex trafficking.To conduct sex trafficking, traffickers rely on the transportation and hospitality sectors for moving and controlling victims, giving these sectors a critical role as the first line of defense.Regarding forced labor, repeal of the consumptive demand clause in 2016 heightened the need for businesses to be cognizant of labor risks.The financial sector also plays a role in eliminating forced labor.

While he was deployed to Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom, Knight suffered an injury that ended his military career. He was honorably discharged at the rank of specialist in 2015. With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition. Knight was awarded the vehicle as a result of his winning entry into the annual Hiring Our Heroes\u2019 Committed to America\u2019s Heroes sweepstakes conducted late last year. The sweepstakes was open to all active duty, reserve and guard service members, veterans and military spouses and more than 85,000 entries were received.\u201cHiring Our Heroes and Toyota are working together to provide an opportunity for military families by offering valuable career development and training, online resources, and education. At DeLuca Toyota, we\u2019ve been serving the North Central Florida community since 1978 and we\u2019ve always taken an active role in supporting the community. We have several staff members that are veterans who have served our country.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars a year in illicit profit. All victims of trafficking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.Industry has an important role to play. Businesses cannot do this work alone. The business community needs to partner with governments and non-governmental organizations to address the scope of this problemBusinesses face an economic, legal, and reputational risk if they engage in human trafficking. The task force develops toolkits, hosts forums, and engages in advocacy work to shine a spotlight on this problem.According to the International Labor Organization, whereas 19% of victims are trafficked for commercial sex and make up a vast majority of illicit profits, incidences of forced labor are prevalent and widespread globally. To eradicate human trafficking, the task force addresses forced labor in supply chains and commercial sex trafficking.To conduct sex trafficking, traffickers rely on the transportation and hospitality sectors for moving and controlling victims, giving these sectors a critical role as the first line of defense.Regarding forced labor, repeal of the consumptive demand clause in 2016 heightened the need for businesses to be cognizant of labor risks.The financial sector also plays a role in eliminating forced labor.

We are thrilled to present a new vehicle to Ernest Knight, a third-generation veteran, who proudly served in the U.S. Army,\u201d said Adam Rocke, Senior Director of Events and Programs at Hiring Our Heroes.Originally from Portsmouth, Virginia, Knight, 31, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2013 and worked as a food service specialist. While he was deployed to Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom, Knight suffered an injury that ended his military career. He was honorably discharged at the rank of specialist in 2015. With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition. Knight was awarded the vehicle as a result of his winning entry into the annual Hiring Our Heroes\u2019 Committed to America\u2019s Heroes sweepstakes conducted late last year. The sweepstakes was open to all active duty, reserve and guard service members, veterans and military spouses and more than 85,000 entries were received.\u201cHiring Our Heroes and Toyota are working together to provide an opportunity for military families by offering valuable career development and training, online resources, and education. At DeLuca Toyota, we\u2019ve been serving the North Central Florida community since 1978 and we\u2019ve always taken an active role in supporting the community. We have several staff members that are veterans who have served our country. We are thrilled that this year\u2019s sweepstakes winner is from the Ocala, Florida area,\u201d said Frank DeLuca, owner and president of DeLuca Toyota.Knight has a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice from Radford University and recently earned his master\u2019s degree in criminal justice with an emphasis in critical incident management from Saint Leo University. Knight teaches Zumba at a local sport club. He is currently seeking full-time employment and exploring opportunities to help his fellow veterans pursue their education and career goals. He lives with his fianc\xe9, Julio, in Ocala, Florida. \u201cI am truly happy and grateful to receive a Toyota 4Runner from an organization like Hiring Our Heroes because they really care about veterans,\u201d Knight said. \u201cWhen you leave the military, it\u2019s a scary thing because you have to adjust and transition to something else. It makes me feel good to know that Hiring Our Heroes is helping those that sacrificed so much for our country.\u201d","keywords":["criminal"]},{"text":"Some bureaucrats have publicly pledged to ignore statutory timetables for merger review, taunting companies to close the merger and risk government objection later.

Accordingly, if the PBGC determines that the continued operation of the plan somehow poses a financial risk to itself, the PBGC may impose as a condition of providing financial assistance that the plan be terminated. While ERISA states that minimum funding does not apply to a plan that terminates by mass withdrawal, there is no such provision relating to termination by plan amendment. Though the PBGC has opined that insolvent plans will continue to operate, there does appear to be at least a statutory mechanism through which a plan can be terminated without consent of the employer or even the trustees.

Its origins stretch back to the 1960s, and the rapid improvement of the technology has unlocked numerous applications across various industries. For instance, government applications include airline passenger facilitation and criminal investigations, and commercial applications include theft prevention in the retail industry, fraud detection, and automated photo tagging. Biometric facial verification, when done properly, is much more accurate than human facial verification. For example, passport officers are, at most, 80% accurate in matching passport photos to people, while facial algorithms are about 99% accurate for most traveler galleries. Given the diverse uses of the technology, a moratorium on federal use would create uncertainty and have a chilling effect on innovation throughout the facial recognition ecosystem.
