It began with the California Supreme Court, which in 2018 unilaterally changed its standard for interpreting whether an individual can be classified as an independent contractor. The Court’s decision in a case known as Dynamex rewrote the existing law and adopted a modified “ABC” test for evaluating an employment relationship.  The ABC test is known as such because it uses three factors (A,B, and C) to evaluate an independent contractor relationship.  Flunk any one of the three factors and a worker becomes an employee.  Critically, Dynamex  removed an important element of Part B of the test that had facilitated business relationships with independent contractors in other states using an ABC test of their own.\",\n      \"For their part, opponents of AB 5 began the effort to pass a ballot initiative to exempt app-based drivers and delivery workers from the law and thereby allow them to remain independent contractors. To be sure, organized labor, which was eager to unionize the thousands of workers who would be forced into employment relationships, campaigned vehemently against Proposition 22 with its usual overheated rhetoric, but in the end voters apparently were not swayed.

Uber’s “UberX” service debuted in July 2012, and Lyft entered the market in August 2012. Economic research has shown that the emergence of ride-hailing services increased competition.

This increase in plan liabilities can only be addressed through increased contributions or benefit reductions, which will take time to implement. A five-year period is not long enough to transition to a new formula because these plans are subject to the collective bargaining cycle, which can vary from 3 to 5 years.

And even freelancers and independent contractors who voted “no” on a union would still be bound by all the wages and working conditions negotiated in a union contract because of the laws around exclusive representation.

The consideration of remote work may be both a benefit and a challenge to our future retention and hiring, however – as we look at fully opening our office again and asking staff to come back in, the continued interest in full-time remote work may result in some incumbents saying “no” to returning to the office environment and/or candidates turning down a position that may require them to come into the office.\",\n      \"The pandemic has been devastating to the hospitality industry workforce.

As the airport and aviation sector rebounds from the COVID crisis, the greatest challenge is to rapidly respond to the need to replace the workforce that took early retirement, were laid off, or engaged in alternate employment (consulting or leaving the field).

As the apartment industry continues to recover, more in-unit maintenance activities will resume, and it is expected that job growth will continue to rise in the maintenance career pathway. However, recruiting qualified maintenance professionals is challenging due to a lack of industry awareness, competition with higher-paying construction-related jobs, and difficulty reaching the desired audience through advertising.

Broadband access is also important for the use of online productivity tools, and of course, to businesses whose business model relies on consumer access to broadband. Moreover, the economic implications are substantial; IoT is expected to provide a total economic impact of $14.4 trillion by 2025. The digital economy already provides $2 trillion in annual value to the U.S. economy.

These broadband programs were all financed through general appropriations. This indicates that Congress is able, and readily willing, to finance broadband programs through the appropriations process. Moreover, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress established and funded a number of broadband programs across the federal government. Examples include the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Broadband ReConnect Program and the Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund.\",\n      \"Second, in response to Question 12, the Chamber expresses strong concerns about requirements contained in the IIJA that would subject broadband to Buy America requirements (17). Artificial barriers to broadband deployment, including domestic content requirements, will significantly hinder IIJA’s stated objectives of closing the digital divide and providing consumers access to high-speed broadband (18). The present workforce and supply chain challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates this concern, directly impacting the expeditious deployment of broadband infrastructure (19). NTIA should recognize the substantial challenges of applying domestic content requirements to broadband, considering much of the broadband equipment necessary to build broadband networks is not American-made (20). The Chamber recommends that NTIA, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, collaborate with affected stakeholders to address any consequences resulting from imposing domestic content restrictions.\",\n      \"Fourth, in response to Question 18, the Chamber recommends that NTIA consider community health needs for connectivity as an eligible use to facilitate the BEAD goals of digital equity.

The annual report reviews the global state of intellectual property (IP) rights protection and enforcement.“Innovations enabled by IP are delivering us from the current pandemic, and can defend us against the next one – if predictable, reliable, and enforceable intellectual property rights remain available world-wide to secure the underlying investments. USTR’s work to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the global IP infrastructure is critical to a healthy innovation ecosystem. With the Special 301 Report as a blueprint, we can enhance the legal and economic environment to support the vaccine researchers, movie and music producers, scientific journal publishers, software and telecommunications engineers, and countless others whose cutting-edge products have supported us throughout this crisis.“This year, in its filing, the U.S. Chamber identified systemic and market-specific IP issues in global markets like: Brazil, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Vietnam, Turkey, Korea, China, and Mexico (among others). We focused on harmful policy realities like: insufficient patent protection; compulsory licensing; inadequate responses to counterfeiting and piracy; forced screen and broadcast quotas; localization requirements; regulatory approval delays; unfair competition law proceedings and extraterritorial remedies; data transfer restrictions; and general market access barriers.“Today, we reiterate our concern that the mistaken belief that IP rights can be a barrier to access for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has induced some countries, U.N agencies and special interest groups to seek to undermine those rights. Let me be clear: IP rights help – they don’t hinder – access to innovation by enabling long-term investments in technology in the first instance, and by supporting a wide range of public and private partnerships to appropriately share know-how and capabilities through IP licensing.  The U.S. Chamber International IP Index shows that countries with strong IP systems have significantly higher innovation production, invention rates, and knowledge output – as well as greater access to innovation.“We thank USTR and the U.S. government as a whole for their consideration of our filing and, more importantly, we commend them for their efforts to promote and protect American intellectual property at home and around the world.”\",\n      \"“​​At no other point in recent history has the need for immigration reform been greater than it is today.

Specifically, DHS should give employers more flexibility to accept electronic documents or document copies instead of the original hard copy, which would significantly reduce the burdens on employers and employees alike, as well as prevent workforce disruptions. USCIS should update the M-274 Handbook for Employers to clarify that employers may accept electronic USCIS approval notices for Form I-9 purposes. USCIS processing delays, coupled with U.S. Postal Service delays due to COVID-19, frequently leave employers with no choice but to suspend employment when an employee has an electronic USCIS approval notice but has not yet received the physical notice in the mail. These types of disruptions would be easily avoidable if electronic documents and copies of documents were acceptable for the purposes of validating one’s employment eligibility in the U.S.\",\n      \"Relatedly, there have been several policy changes implemented by DHS and USCIS that have impacted what documents are sufficient to determine an individual’s employment eligibility in the U.S. For example, USCIS expanded the eligibility for an automatic 180-day Employment Authorization Document (EAD) extension to the dependent spouses of H-1B, and L-1, and E nonimmigrant workers. To that end, USCIS clarified that E and L dependent spouses are to be considered work authorized incident to their status, regardless if they physically possess an EAD. There have also been many other temporary policy changes caused by COVID where the agency is providing employers with flexibility regarding certain documentation. DHS should clarify these policy changes publicly and provide employers with easy access to this guidance. The business community and workers would benefit greatly from additional clarity.\",\n      \"With regard to those temporary employees who have since left the employment of the company that performed the I-9 document verification for the employee virtually, there is a lack of guidance as to what companies should do to verify former employees, notwithstanding the statutory record retention requirements and the ability of the company to copy the documents under the INA.2 As for the workers that were onboarded by a company using these virtual procedures and are still employed by said company, it is simply impractical for a business that onboarded thousands of people using virtual means to perform a physical inspection of the identity and employment eligibility documentation for thousands of workers in a 72 hour period. The disruption that this would cause for firms in this type of situation would have been significant. As such, this single concern drove many companies to not make use of the virtual verification option. Moreover, even for those companies that chose to take advantage of this flexibility during the height of the pandemic, a significant number of those companies discontinued using the virtual option to avoid potential liability for violations that could have arisen if they needed to verify their workers’ documentation in short order.\",\n      \"Companies that took advantage of the remote document examination policy established in March 2020 improved the onboarding experience not only for their businesses, but also for their employees. Chamber members found the remote process to be much more efficient and cost-effective than the traditional in-person procedure. Given the difficulties many businesses had to confront during the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies conveyed to us that the ability to perform the document verification process virtually was indispensable in allowing them to continue both onboarding new hires and reverifying the documents for existing employees whose documents had expired. These temporary measures allowed many companies to avoid significant workforce disruptions during the worst periods of the pandemic.\",\n      \"The Chamber supported ICE’s March 20, 2020 announcement that initially provided the flexibility to remotely perform the I-9 document verification. We continue to support the extension of these temporary policies through April 30, 2022.1 There were many companies who used this policy flexibility to effectively onboard much-needed workers during the height of the pandemic. In doing so, these companies avoided critical workforce disruptions. However, there were many employers that, due to the critical shortcomings associated with the temporary policy, either declined to take advantage of the temporary policy flexibility altogether, or only made use of these policies for a brief period.\",\n      \"Modernizing our immigration system is a step toward alleviating many concerns that are weighing heavily on the minds of American citizens today.

The consular processing backlogs caused by the pandemic and these pandemic-related entry restrictions will continue to hinder the ability of companies to meet their workforce for some time moving ahead. These policies were instituted in real-time during a national emergency and different administrations went about implementing these National Interest Exception (NIE) procedures in different ways. It remains an open question as to which cabinet level department should have been charged with effectuating the adjudication of these NIE requests.\",\n      \"Last, but certainly not least, the Department makes no mention as to whether its CoSM accounted for the costs associated with the State Department’s adjudications of National Interest Exceptions (“NIEs”) under the several COVID-19 travel restrictions that either were or are still in place today. Businesses fully appreciate the fact that these presidential proclamations created new requirements that increased the number of hours that consular officials needed to expend in adjudicating various types of consular applications. However, the Department provided no explanation in its NPRM as to how these proclamations factored into its formulation for its cost estimates. Presumably, these proclamations will not exist in perpetuity, and employers hope that the State Department made reasonable assumptions as to how such proclamations would impact its cost modeling. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the NPRM to show employers how these presidential proclamations, particularly the increased resources needed to comply with them, influenced how the new CoSM used by the Department helped them arrive at their proposed fee increases. Further transparency would help alleviate any trepidation that employers have regarding the veracity of the Department’s conclusions in establishing its proposed consular fee schedule.\",\n      \"Businesses have other questions regarding the assumptions the State Department made to fashion its new CoSM. One other important topic companies have raised is whether consular facilities remain closed due to the pandemic. While we appreciate that the State Department offered stakeholders some limited access to review its CoSM data,7 more transparency is needed from the State Department for the business community to determine whether the NPRM’s fee increases are based on legitimate assumptions. As of October 2021, 60% of consulates worldwide remained partially or fully closed to nonemergency nonimmigrant visa appointments, with 40% of all consulates worldwide still remaining fully closed. The NPRM makes no mention of how this state of affairs has influenced the ability of consular officials to timely process the applications listed in the proposal, and whether the reopening of consulates would help boost processing efficiencies.\",\n      \"When the first series of COVID-19 entry restrictions were imposed by the Trump Administration, both the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security were provided with the authority to adjudicate NIE requests. However, once these proclamations were implemented in practice, DHS assumed the primary role in adjudicating NIE requests. This lasted through the first few weeks of the Biden Administration, but that changed drastically when the Department of State took over the vast majority of these adjudications as the months passed. Many Chamber members recall these developments vividly, as these changes in policy caused significant disruptions for their businesses. Key executives and critical workers found themselves stuck abroad for inordinate amounts of time as these changes were effectuated and the criteria for obtaining an NIE became much more strict.\",\n      \"Noting the dramatic decrease in work volumes during the pandemic, the Department projects that demand for consular service will be depressed for several years into the future. As such, the Department decided to use a 10-year, rather than a 5-year, average of historical and projected workload volumes to calculate unit costs in this CoSM. The Department decided that doing so would minimize volatility in unit costs. Using this longer time frame to assess workload volumes, the Department estimates that demand for consular services is still lower than in prior CoSMs and will remain so for quite some time. “As a result,” the Department noted, “the calculated unit cost for these services, which is total service cost divided by total service volume, has increased.”\",\n      \"This year, underserved communities have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Researchers at University of Pennsylvania, Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman, spent over a decade conducting research on synthetic mRNA and published the findings in 2005. This foundational research inspired founders of Moderna to use mRNA for medicines and raised $2 billion on the concept before going public in 2018. Soon after the world became aware of the COVID-19 virus, Moderna researchers used the mRNA technique to create a vaccine and was one of the first drugmakers to develop a vaccine suitable for clinical trials. Operation Warp Speed, through funding appropriated by the CARES Act, provided Moderna with $2.58 billion in two grants to facilitate development of their vaccine.Likewise, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also utilized mRNA to develop a COVID19 vaccine. BioNTech similarly licensed the novel technology developed at the University of Pennsylvania to try to harness the medical potential of mRNA. At the onset of the pandemic, BioNTech partnered with Pfizer, an 171 year old biopharmaceutical company, to develop and test their mRNA vaccine candidate. While Pfizer did not receive R&D funding through Operation Warp Speed, the federal government agreed to pay $1.95 billion to purchase 100 million doses of the vaccine.Federal support for basic research is not the only public policy whose benefits are highlighted by the new vaccines. Immigrant innovators were often the tip of the spear, and the ability of firms to draw on global production networks sourcing inputs from around the globe has proven essential to the development and deployment—with unprecedented speed—of these novel and impressive vaccines. There are important lessons here for elected officials considering the direction of U.S. immigration, trade, and supply chain policies.Last December, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorizations for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA-based vaccines. The story of both vaccines illustrates how basic federal funding – for either R&D or the medicines themselves – paired with private sector expertise can lead to game-changing medical innovations in record time.\",\n      '\"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports Chairman Bobby Scott’s introduction of the Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act of 2021, which aims to protect workers’ and retirees’ pensions and the employers that contribute to them.

A recent Washington Post-Schar School poll found similar results, with one-third of workers under the age of 40 considering changing careers or switching industries since the pandemic.

Those statistics underscore a trend among workers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, to seek out businesses and jobs that align with their values.

People aren’t likely to relocate for a job anymore, and with the pressure businesses are under to fill open jobs, they aren’t likely to request that candidates move as a condition of employment either. Together, those two dynamics mean that employers have a much wider canvas for recruiting, and workers have a much bigger palette of companies to which they can apply.\",\n      \"The financial damage wrought by the pandemic can be quantified, but the mental and emotional toll cannot. There is still a very real fear factor for workers on the frontlines — from nurses and other healthcare professionals to restaurant and retail workers — whose jobs involve high-contact interactions with other people. Burnout, anxiety, and other mental health issues are prompting these workers to switch industries. A recent survey of critical care nurses found that 66% have considered leaving their jobs because of the pandemic, citing fear of exposing themselves or their families to COVID-19 as the main reason. “Many industries require people to be on the ground doing work with other people,” says Broberg. “There is certainly still some degree of fear factor today, the question is whether that fear will continue and if so to what degree.

If the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (that enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act) declines to proceed with a discrimination charge but the employee has not acted on their Notice of Right to Sue, would that be considered adjudicated?

But the campaign finance provisions of H.R. 1 are not finely-tuned. Perhaps the most striking example is H.R. 1’s sweeping regulation of so-called “campaign-related disbursements,” which captures a brand-new category of communications that “promote,” “attack,” “support,” or “oppose” a candidate or elected official (“PASO communications”). Unlike existing campaign finance law, which regulates speech that either expressly advocates a candidate’s election or defeat or that mentions a candidate in relatively close temporal proximity to an election, the vague and overly broad new definition of PASO communications applies year-round and threatens to consume any legislative advocacy that dares mention an elected official. The penalties imposed by H.R. 1 for engaging in PASO communications are severe – a group that spends more than an aggregate of $10,000 on such communications over a two-year election cycle must, among other things, file reports publicly disclosing all of its donors who have given it more than $10,000 during the election cycle.

Although it may frustrate opponents of free speech, the FEC’s current, non-partisan structure was not an accident – it was a careful and conscious choice made by Congress forty-four years ago to respect the contours of the First Amendment, avoid chilling legitimate speech, and prevent the FEC from becoming a political weapon. It was a recognition that when there are close calls, the tie should be resolved in favor of free speech and not censorship or politically motivated enforcement actions.

Transatlantic data transfers enable an array of essential activities, including multi-country clinical trials for innovative medicines such as COVID-19 vaccines, cybersecurity threat information sharing, and anti-fraud and anti-money laundering efforts.\",\n      \"What these examples show is that data is necessary to a functioning 21st century society. Privacy legislation should include exceptions for important societally beneficial purposes such as anti-money laundering and fraud protection, research, and commercial credit reporting. Unfortunately, HB 1330 provides NO exceptions to its privacy requirements.\",\n      \"First, I would like to note that data is transforming our economy and has been vital in keeping the “digital lights on” for many companies, particularly small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic whether that be through contact tracing, enabling faster distribution of PPP loans by fintech companies, or helping Americans stay connected through remote work, ecommerce, online learning, and telehealth. Prior to the pandemic, C_TEC released a report which showed that even as the number of data breaches increases, identity theft is holding at around the same levels. This is in part due to data being used to identify fraud and stop it in its tracks.2 We’ve also found that data used by the private sector is helping protect citizens from wildfires, promote financial inclusion, and enhance public safety. Private-sector data enabled law enforcement to locate and stop the San Bernardino mass shooter during his spree.[2]\",\n      \"We need a tough stance on cyber threats, working with allied partners when possible and unilaterally when necessary to deter and punish criminals and their state-sponsors.\",\n      \"Human tracking is a global problem affecting millions of people each year who are illegally lured into forced labor and sexual exploitation through force, fraud, or coercion.

It is therefore important to be prepared. In the marketplace, everyone understands the principle of supply and demand. Demand creates a market, and supply will meet demand, with unscrupulous exploiters working to fill it with an eye to the greatest profit margin for themselves. Traffickers use violence, intimidation, and manipulation as trafficking is often hidden in plain sight. Therefore, no demand = no victim = no trafficking. The business community is well positioned to be on the frontline in the fight against trafficking. From a risk management approach, anti-trafficking training should be provided in the workplace. Companies should also adopt an anti-trafficking-in-persons policy with a demand-reduction focus. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world’s largest business federation representing the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, in collaboration with Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT), a nonprofit organization that educates, equips, empowers, and mobilizes members of the trucking, bus, and energy industries to combat human trafficking, produced this toolkit to highlight resources and best practices on how to help end this heinous crime.\",\n      \"Experts on barriers to employment for job seekers—like access to childcare, immigration constraints, and having a criminal record—joined the summit to explore practical solutions that employers can put into practice now, and policy changes at the federal and state level that would help connect employers to job seekers.\",\n      \"Overcoming a criminal record: One in three Americans has a criminal background, and every year more than 600,000 American former inmates return to society and face incredible hurdles when it comes to getting hired, according to the Society for Human Research Management (SHRM).

Triple and quadruple ransomware extortion attacks are also on the rise, and those involve either re-victimization or victimization of customers and business partners.\",\n      \"Wrong. Businesses of all sizes are targets of ransomware attacks. Malicious actors have targeted small and large businesses alike, and they can be highly specific in whom they target. All kinds of companies are on the receiving end of phishing campaigns, where emails or text messages go out with malicious links. Identifying dangerous emails is becoming more and more difficult as cybercriminals become more sophisticated. A bad actor might feel like they can secure a larger payday from a bigger target, but every company is at risk.\",\n      \"Ransomware is a type of cyberattack that couples unauthorized access to a company's systems and networks with a demand for payment. Typically, data or systems are locked through encryption of a victim's files, with businesses unable to recover data and get systems running again until they pay a ransom.\",\n      \"While victim organizations are forced to make difficult business decisions to pay a ransom, there are legal and regulatory obligations that organizations must be aware of. The U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued an updated advisory to highlight the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments to specially designated nationals and proactive steps businesses can take to mitigate such risks. Ransomware victims may consider engaging an outside counsel before and during a ransomware event to better understand the legal and regulatory risks.\",\n      \"At present, there is not enough data on the number of attacks and the number of payments made to answer this question with a good deal of fidelity. But we do know that the absolute numbers are large and growing. Victims of ransomware attacks will need to make the difficult business decision as to whether it makes sense to pay the ransom against the operational, financial, and customer-related impacts of being shut down. The alternative to not paying is to rely solely on backup data or backup systems that are not affected by the breach, which is why it's important to prepare in advance for ransomware attacks. On top of this, ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has become more common. Cybercriminals like Darkside and REvil employ customer service teams to help victims make ransomware payments, navigate malware removal, and even negotiate the payment amount.\",\n      \"Traditional cyberattacks are used to steal information, conduct espionage, and cause destruction and disruption. Cyberattacks historically have included the theft of passwords, personal information, trade secrets, and other intellectual property; destruction of servers; and overloading systems with traffic. But ransomware is different in that data or systems are held hostage with payment demanded.\",\n      \"Ransomware threat actors have moved to double, triple, and quadruple extortion attacks for a few reasons. First, there's a chance a victim will pay with each level of extortion. Secondly, organizations' cyber resilience has improved. Data backups are much more commonplace than they were 10 years ago. Bad actors may not be able to do much if a victim has a backup, but the victim may pay if threatened with their data being released to the public.\",\n      \"The bad actors that develop and use ransomware continue to learn and evolve over time. One way they have done this is by upping the pressure on a victim organization to pay a ransom in a certain amount of time. Let's call that a single extortion attack. Malicious malware software is injected, data is encrypted, and a demand is made.\",\n      \"Ransomware attacks — a type of cyberattack where an attacker uses malicious software to block access to a victim's systems and data until the victim pays a \\\"ransom\\\" in exchange for the release of such data — are on the rise.

Nor does it contain a carve-out that would allow labor unions to use pre-dispute arbitration to resolve their disputes while denying the use of arbitration to others. Arbitration provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court. Empirical studies demonstrate that employees in arbitration do just as well, or in many circumstances, considerably better, than in court. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, the flexibility of arbitration served complainants and businesses alike well as arbitration cases proceeded on schedule, while courthouses were forced to close their doors and developed significant backlogs that still present a challenge today.\",\n      \"S. 3143 provides that workplace victims of the violent crime of sexual assault would not be subject to mandatory arbitration provisions in employment contracts. It also sets forth numerous robust rights in arbitration for victims of sexual harassment, including the right to report harassment and to speak out publicly.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates that human trafficking is second only to drug trafficking as the most profitable form of transnational crime, generating billions of dollars a year in illicit profit. All victims of trafficking share one essential experience: the loss of freedom.Industry has an important role to play. Businesses cannot do this work alone. The business community needs to partner with governments and non-governmental organizations to address the scope of this problemBusinesses face an economic, legal, and reputational risk if they engage in human trafficking. The task force develops toolkits, hosts forums, and engages in advocacy work to shine a spotlight on this problem.According to the International Labor Organization, whereas 19% of victims are trafficked for commercial sex and make up a vast majority of illicit profits, incidences of forced labor are prevalent and widespread globally. To eradicate human trafficking, the task force addresses forced labor in supply chains and commercial sex trafficking.To conduct sex trafficking, traffickers rely on the transportation and hospitality sectors for moving and controlling victims, giving these sectors a critical role as the first line of defense.Regarding forced labor, repeal of the consumptive demand clause in 2016 heightened the need for businesses to be cognizant of labor risks.The financial sector also plays a role in eliminating forced labor. Since 2018, financial institutions such as banks have been required by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to identify and report suspicious activity related to human trafficking.Employers, in conjunction with social service providers, counseling firms, housing agencies, and skills-based training organizations, provide resources for human trafficking victims to heal. This work is done in conjunction with comprehensive social service providers and researchers.As the leading voice of business, the U.S. Chamber plays a critical role in addressing human trafficking.

We focused on harmful policy realities like: insufficient patent protection; compulsory licensing; inadequate responses to counterfeiting and piracy; forced screen and broadcast quotas; localization requirements; regulatory approval delays; unfair competition law proceedings and extraterritorial remedies; data transfer restrictions; and general market access barriers.“Today, we reiterate our concern that the mistaken belief that IP rights can be a barrier to access for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics has induced some countries, U.N agencies and special interest groups to seek to undermine those rights. Let me be clear: IP rights help – they don’t hinder – access to innovation by enabling long-term investments in technology in the first instance, and by supporting a wide range of public and private partnerships to appropriately share know-how and capabilities through IP licensing.  The U.S. Chamber International IP Index shows that countries with strong IP systems have significantly higher innovation production, invention rates, and knowledge output – as well as greater access to innovation.“We thank USTR and the U.S. government as a whole for their consideration of our filing and, more importantly, we commend them for their efforts to promote and protect American intellectual property at home and around the world.”\",\n      \"To learn more, check out the U.S. Chamber International IP Index and explore the interactive map.\",\n      \"The U.S. Chamber International IP Index (the Index) illustrates the choice is clear.

Our success has been dependent upon the strength of public-private partnerships with organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and Toyota. We are thrilled to present a new vehicle to Ernest Knight, a third-generation veteran, who proudly served in the U.S. Army,” said Adam Rocke, Senior Director of Events and Programs at Hiring Our Heroes.Originally from Portsmouth, Virginia, Knight, 31, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2013 and worked as a food service specialist. While he was deployed to Kuwait during Operation Enduring Freedom, Knight suffered an injury that ended his military career. He was honorably discharged at the rank of specialist in 2015. With help from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran Readiness and Employment program in Salem, Virginia, Knight received personalized counseling and educational support to guide him during his military transition. Knight was awarded the vehicle as a result of his winning entry into the annual Hiring Our Heroes’ Committed to America’s Heroes sweepstakes conducted late last year. The sweepstakes was open to all active duty, reserve and guard service members, veterans and military spouses and more than 85,000 entries were received.“Hiring Our Heroes and Toyota are working together to provide an opportunity for military families by offering valuable career development and training, online resources, and education. At DeLuca Toyota, we’ve been serving the North Central Florida community since 1978 and we’ve always taken an active role in supporting the community. We have several staff members that are veterans who have served our country. We are thrilled that this year’s sweepstakes winner is from the Ocala, Florida area,” said Frank DeLuca, owner and president of DeLuca Toyota.Knight has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Radford University and recently earned his master’s degree in criminal justice with an emphasis in critical incident management from Saint Leo University. Knight teaches Zumba at a local sport club. He is currently seeking full-time employment and exploring opportunities to help his fellow veterans pursue their education and career goals. He lives with his fiancé, Julio, in Ocala, Florida. “I am truly happy and grateful to receive a Toyota 4Runner from an organization like Hiring Our Heroes because they really care about veterans,” Knight said. “When you leave the military, it’s a scary thing because you have to adjust and transition to something else.

Surveys showed that many previously exempt employees valued the flexible hours and work schedules that exempt status provided. Furthermore, because the rule applied to all employers, some charitable non-profits could not afford to keep employees working the same hours and would have been forced to reduce the services they provide. The regulation was eventually struck down by a federal judge in Texas who ruled that the new threshold was so high it rendered moot the salary test for exempt status.
